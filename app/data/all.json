If the party does not accept the invitation, the brothers will continue on their way peacefully. If the party accepts the invitation, the brothers will lead them down the path to the witch cabin. They will crouch at the edge of the woods to observe the cabin, whispering tales of the witches’ kidnappings and evil deeds to the party. After a short time observing the cabin, the brothers will state that the witches must be out and that it would be best to wait inside and ambush them upon returning. The brothers will lead the party into the house, suspiciously looking around at the insides. If the PCs perform a search of the cabin, they can easily find a trap door which leads to the basement. The brothers will otherwise find the trap door and suggest that they go into the basement to wait for the witches so that they aren’t seen through the windows, and they will lead the way down. Once the entire party has entered the basement, the brothers will look around suspiciously, waving their torch. They turn toward the party and smile as their disguises melt away and they reveal themselves as the witches and they will be hunting the party. The basement goes dark, leaving the party to illuminate their own way and two cackling female voices will echo through the labyrinthine basement. “We’re on a witch hunt… a witch hunt.” “A witch hunt a witch hunt...” “Run run run run...” as the witches run away from the party before combat begins. The will be played by the board game “Labrynth” with the PCs arranged in the center of the board and the witches dispersed.

   "Description": "This is an abandoned watchtower in the mountain passes that has slowly been buried by snow and ice -- it lies, half-leaning, half-toppled, back upon a steep slope of ice and rock. To scale the tower, you must pick your way both through ruined and crumpled rooms, and through caves and tunnels in the tumble of icy boulders behind. At the top lives a young white dragon, whose hoard includes a cursed sword..."

The Blood Pits are a series of claustrophobic tunnels and chambers, subject to erratic blasts of steam and scalding sulfuric acid, where the pit fiend Gujerikk personally torments his collection of souls. New arrivals are shackled and subjected to flaying, par-boiling, and witnessing the souls of their loved ones suffer (when possible). Once sufficiently broken, souls are released into the lower tunnels where they are endlessly hunted for sport by Gujerikk's hounds and the fiend himself."

   "Description": "Sir Gordan, called the Green Knight, was a celebrated hero of the wars with the mountain clans. On a moonless night, with only his squire, he slipped into the clans' camp, slaughtered two chiefs and brought a third out as a hostage to force an end to the conflict. He never liked talking about how he managed the feat. Years later he died, a respected old knight at court and was buried in the Crown's Temple, as befits a hero. On the first new moon after his interment, a young priestess was beheaded while tending candles at the temple's high altar. On the second new moon after his interment, an old woman was cloven nearly in two while praying in a chapel within the temple. On the third new moon, the temple was cleared save a veteran priest and demon-hunter and his assistant. In the morning, they were dead of sword wounds. Finger-painting in his blood the priest had left one word: \"Gordan.\" Afraid to move the cursed knight, his crypt was sealed off completely. That was years ago, now a young priestess swears she can hear scratching and tapping below the temple on nights when the moon is dark."

The death of the king's son gave them just that opportunity. Before the interment, members of the alchemists' guild had rolled vast barrels of dragontar into the catacombs beneath the Temple of the Dead and dripped a trail to the three known entry points on the surface. During the interment, when the funeral party was all underground, the dragontar was lit, consuming all those participating in the ceremony. Occasionally, mischievous boys will find their way into the Deadways; they don't always find their way out."

The tales suggest that the demon broke free and raged about the place killing every brother, servant, and visitor.

   "Description": "Carved into living rock far beneath the mountaintops once lay the mighty Irondark Hold. A vast stronghold that protected the dwarvish mining operations throughout the tunnels of the Iron Mountains, Irondark Hold is now sodden home to a foul thing. The thing whispered to the Lord of Irondark of the rich deposits of diamonds that lay in solid rock beneath the fortress. Haunted by dreams of glittering gems, the greedy lord dug more and more tunnels directly beneath the fortress, creating an unstable network of tunnels. One day, when the Irondark Legion returned from a campaign against the goblins, the tunnels beneath the fortress collapsed. The fortress crashed through nearly 200 feet of tunnels before resting for a few moments on a floor of stone that cracked and gave way before the fortress plunged 2,000 feet into a shallow subterranean sea. The thing that whispered still haunts the broken stones of Irondark Hold. Several dwarvish expeditions have been lost attempting to recover ancestral weapons and relics that had been in the fortress."

Driven mad by the voices of those he had killed or raised, he created a lair in which to hide. As each area of this complex was finished, he would decide where it would go from there. The workers would follow his orders out of fear and greed as he paid well. This led to a twisting turning maze of chambers, hallways, and stairs; many of which led nowhere. Eventually, Meerlac, driven to utter madness, was unable to communicate with others and his workers abandoned him in his lair where he roamed wildly until his death and perhaps still roams it today."

What is known is that they are located in the depths of a dark swamp and that they stand on the only truly solid ground available in the area. The commonly held rumor is that there is a dark magic at work inside that remains from the days when the ruins were a keep. This magic seems to have had an effect on the rats that have made their home there, leading them to be smarter, bigger, and aggressive. Some even speculate that the rats who have become intelligent enough to gain sentience have started a cult worshiping an ancient god they discovered in the chapel of the keep. While they have not yet, some fear that soon the rats will begin raiding nearby settlements for blood sacrifices for their new found deity."

   "Description": "More than a century ago, an incredibly powerful -- and quite insane -- mage accumulated a massive hoard of wealth. But so paranoid was he of thieves and pilferers, that in order to protect his fortune, he decided to spend some of it to build a massive vault in the middle of a vast desert. Its exact location has since been lost to time and the shifting desert sands, but according to those who claim to have found it, from the outside, it appears to be a plain single-story stone building with a single entrance and a few small windows, but the structure extends deep underground, and is filled with many traps and hazards, magical and otherwise. As you descend, you will see larger and larger stashes of gold coins and bars, all minted with the mage's face. You will also encounter beasts and monstrosities that are attracted to gold and treasure, having been lured there by the sizable hoard. At the bottom-most level is a massive vault room where the mage's remains lie among his mountains of gold, having locked himself in shortly after the structure's completion. Unfortunately, even death won't be enough to keep him from letting go of his fortune."

   "Description": "Eons ago, an unknown entity built this massive, magically-automated facility to ceaselessly manufacture golems to use as an endless army of servants and soldiers. Now, whoever built this place is long since gone, but the arcane machinery functions still. Perhaps it's been running nonstop since it was created, or perhaps it went dormant for untold years and has just reawoken; in either case, the factory is producing golems around the clock now, and these servants are performing their tasks as they were programmed to. They scatter throughout the lands, collecting raw materials to use in the construction of new golems, resulting in an ever-growing swarm of automatons of every shape and size, all built using the consumed resources of the surrounding area. Unfortunately, the required materials are beginning to become scarce in the area, and the swarms of golems are expanding their search further and further -- its only a matter of time before they encounter modern settlements. What's worse, any party looking to shut down the factory are in for more than they bargained for, as the massive golem \"overseer\" won't take kindly to any attempts to harm his reason for being."

   "Type": "Ornate Underground Burial Chambers",
   "Description": "An old King of the campaign world was a next level narcissist, and decided that when he died he would be buried in a tomb that would properly reflect the splendor of his life. So, he designed a burial chamber that would reflect just how amazing a man he was. He laid out his chamber so that visitors would have to pass through multiple rooms to reach the chamber he was actually interred, and each room would be a scene from his life. The first room was a replica of the playroom he spent his childhood in. The second room was a replica of his classroom where he demonstrated his early brilliance and awed his teachers (that's how he remembers it.). The third room was a sparring ground where he showed his extreme proficiency with all known weapons (again, that's how he remembers it.). And so on. Each room was a detailed recreation of his life showing the splendor and glory that he brought to the world (again, as he remembers it, history and reality may remember it differently.). But, he wasn't a fool, he knew there would be those who might attempt to rob his tomb, and so each room was also well stocked with Golems, or Animated objects that would attack any who entered. The toys in the playroom would spring to life and attack, the books in the classroom would hurl themselves at intruders and explode, the weapons in the sparring ground would attempt to do bodily harm to those entering, etc."

Inside, gold coins cover the ground. If one is picked up, the rest animate, skittering away like cockroaches. Dispel magic will stop one coin at a time. Anti-magic fields will stop all coins in their range. If the party drops something broken on the ground, the coins will group up and shove it out. The walls are perfectly smooth, with perfect right angles. Everything is spotless. Blood from battle is quickly caught and run outside by coins. Any opponents are exemplars of their type (in appearance). Final opponent - likely an Elf spellcaster of almost painful beauty (male or female). S/he grew an obsession with perfection, and has created a home without flaws. If any party members have visible scars, tattoos, or other physical flaws, s/he will target them first, regardless of logic."

Nevertheless, the vision of the Empress had been hewn from stone and sweat and silver, and even as the riots swept the streets below, the temple priests - decked in vestments of ermine and velvet - sealed the royal family and their wealth behind ten feet of iron. Now, twenty years hence, the gilded priesthood guard the temple still, patrolling long corridors, tending to the complex locks, and serving as intermediaries between the voices that speak in hushed tones from within the central vault and the outside world. That the royal family hasn't been fed in almost fifteen years is of some small worry to the priests, but their loyalties are clear - to stop any unauthorized bank access with all due force."

In an attempt to better prepare themselves for the flesh-hungry cannibals, a volunteer corp of the Scrimshaw Expeditionary Company willingly underwent 'lycanthropy therapy' in one of the deeper frontier encampments. The results were never guaranteed, and while news from the outer edges of civilization is scarce, rumors suggest that (depending on your perspective) things went either terribly wrong, or wonderfully right. Regardless, representatives of the SEC have been surreptitiously contacting independent adventuring companies, promising heavy coinpurses for anyone willing to bring back evidence that the Wendigo War is going in their favor."

   "Description": "The seas off the coast of Jhead are notoriously treacherous, and for generations the only thing that has made them somewhat navigable is the enchanted light of the Abbey. Built into and around a squat upthrust knuckle of basalt, Saunt Lupine Abbey is centuries older than the order that inhabits it, with tunnels and passages running below and through that are even older. Most of these have long been sealed or gated off by the Abbey's current tenants, but some of the old network can be accessed through sea caves on the backside of the island, and are regularly used by smugglers as a staging point for shipments south. Questioned, both the religious and the roguish will hesitantly speak of the deeper tunnels, beyond the shaped and buttressed ones of their domain. There, they say, lie machines older than the abbey or the island both, humming quietly in dark recesses. If disturbed, dark mechanical sentinels rise up in defense, slaying all that dare trespass."

Ages ago, an insane Elven war-wizard, self-styled an emperor, attempted to conquer the world with the Contraption. The wizard was assassinated and the fledgling nation fell apart. This is the only verifiable history recorded on the Contraption. The origins of it are unknown. Since the fall of the wizard, who's name has been magically removed from history, the Contraption has moved on its own across the land. It is not unoccupied, however. Many constructs have found their way to the Contraption and have taken up maintenence and living there. The Contraption holds untold dangers and likely very few treasures after these centuries past. Still, magicians from all the Plains have sought it. The Contraption is itself an implement of magical work, and is itself the prize."

The world above remains unaware of the fearful goal of the Seed of Gulthias: the creation of a powerful undead, born of with the stake as its heart; perhaps even the rebirth of Gulthias himself.

In order to study his topic of interest, Orvizar established his magic workshop in what was, to him, the most logical location for such an endeavor: A demiplane connected to the Far Realm. Surprisingly, Orvizar is said to have made a great discovery before the abnormal magical activity attracted the attention of one of the denizens of the plane. The entity subsumed the plane, absorbing it such that the workshop itself is inseparable from the creature.

Over the years, the order's sorties recovered many artefacts deemed 'unholy'; the majority of these were destroyed. Of those that weren't, some were brought to the school for use as academic study, and eventually the collection of these built up in the vaults beneath the temple until they reached a critical mass. Unperturbed, the monks devised a new use for the vaults. Young boys' minds were always prone to wandering, straying into thoughts not proper for one being shaped into a noble crusader. The order instituted a new test, a way to reaffirm in the minds of their pupils what the real cost of straying from the true path would be. Deviants were sent in to the vaults, and left to find a route through. Such were the unholy terrors that had accumulated in those depths, many of the boys were overcome and joined the ranks of the undead things - or worse - that prowled in the darkness. But those who came through were reaffirmed in their faith, and often grew to become some of the most bold leaders of that great order. Of course, unholy power of that magnitude could not be contained forever, not with such regular feeding. In time, the contents of the basement overflowed, the temple reduced to an empty and desolate shell. But it still stands today; no-one dares to scrounge the masonry from its walls, and only the most foolhardy would dare to enter the vaults themselves..."

Meanwhile in the sewers, many creatures have gained bizarre new powers: The rats can breathe fire, the bones from old bodies dance and twirl, connecting to form grotesque shapes, spiders create webs out of icicles."

   "Name": "The Cave of Wonders",
   "Type": "Sentient Cave System",
   "Description": "The exterior of this cave in a barren hillside appears to be a giant stone lion's gaping maw. Anyone within a few miles of the cave gets the impression that the cave must hold untold treasures and/or knowledge inside, according to an individual's inner desires. When inside, there are several large chambers with small amounts of treasure, maps, keys, scrolls, or carvings indicating that there is a large trove of desirable treasure in the deepest chamber. The deepest chamber contains much treasure, but the most important thing is a beautiful jeweled dagger on a pedestal. When entering the chamber, one is immediately attracted to this dagger above all else. When one holds the dagger, one is suddenly overcome with an incredible desire to sacrifice oneself then and there to the Cave. When this occurs, the living stone shifts and consumes the corpse, then waits for its next victim. The other treasures within are from consumed adventurers, and if those who enter make the Cave impatient or are somehow satisfied with the little they find in the various antechambers, the Cave spawns ashen ghouls from the living stone who share consciousness with the Cave; so it is that the Cave of Wonders can feed passively or actively."

   "Description": "What used to be a hotspot for illegal activity, the small city of Mondeer had a reputation for illegal trade of unconsenting civilians and the poor. It was ruled by the iron fist of the nefarious burgomaster Ghals Mondeer, a title which he inherited. The town laid within the Mondeer valley (named after the town), and was surrounded by Mt. Vesurian and Mt. Versurate. One fateful day, a storm raged throughout the valley with the strength of the gods. It struck the twin mountains' tops, crumbling them onto the town. The town wasn't destroyed and was instead domed in, trapped from the outside with people still alive within. Resources grew limited, and everyone died within the first few months as the town was ignored by neighbors just over the mountains. Everyone was happy once it had vanished. A recent expedition of the town had a hole blown through the rock barrier, yet none of the explorers have exited. The former slaves after dying have been turned into Poltergeists, protecting every one of the abandoned houses. They don't want to be controlled ever again."

Chasms open up now and again to reveal flecks of blue visible from the floor of this maze. Hoodoos and spires mate with crumbling crevasses and cavern entrances to produce a semi-subterranean, semi-superficial lair for a host of nasty critters.

Shoulder Keep occupies a commanding view of the plain, and its proximity to where the Great Road crosses the Spine made it an important position for protecting overland trade from raiders, before the road was broken. Currently, the keep is held by the Blood-Lion Tribe, a rugged band of orcs, half-orcs, and other mongrel-men who drive a great pack of wolves before them on frequent raids of the plainsfolk's farms and villages.

With white salt stains on grey granite walls, the Rock rises from Holgar's Point a steep promontory cliff some 200 feet in height that protects the harbor from the cold northern winds and waves. The Beacon Tower is the highest tower of Salt Rock, and it serves as both a watchtower and a functioning lighthouse. To descend from the castle to the harbor takes half a day, but signal fires and messenger pigeons keep the garrison and fleet apprised of any threats spotted from the castle above. Short of scaling the slippery cliffs of Holgar's Point, the narrow road up to the keep is the only way to reach it, making it impossible to take by force, but it has fallen by siege at least once. The Rock's  are said to be connected to a vast series of underwater caves where some foul beast of the sea sleeps. It is whispered that the Carlocks keep the sea monster satisfied with meals of prisoners. No one who has ever left the Rock's  alive has seen the caves or the monster, but those former prisoners all agree that the  are cold and damp and that the sound of waves crashing on rock seems to rise up from somewhere inside the walls."

The old aristocracy, unused to having their influence usurped, fought a losing war of charismatic attrition, and before long the balance of power began to tip toward the Mercantile and its allies. In a last bid to capture the hearts of the people - many of whom had suffered greatly during the various Mercantile blockades - the joint Dukes of Il Ipron formulated the first Braggard's Lottery, the winner of which would become Mayor for a year, neatly circumventing the existing elections. The lucky citizen would be given all the rights and duties of the post, as well as all the perks - namely, the Mayor's Mansion - and decent sum of money. The unpublicized downside was that these annual mayorships tended to be incredibly stressful, and were essentially tools used by the Dukes to enforce their will on the influential port town, and wreak their grievances on any who worked for the Mercantile."

As the younger of the two dwarven kingdoms on the continent, its mines do not run as deep, but its position on the last front of the War of Conquest has given cause for extensive aboveground fortifications, including a moat of boiling volcanic spring water. The moat, combined with the bitter cold of the Greyghosts, usually results in Northforge being obscured by vast plumes of steam. Northforge was established during the days of the Dwarven Exodus, when Bjorik Breakhammer's ships were separated from those of his brother by an intense storm. Half of the dwarf fleet went south, and the other half went north, eventually leading to the establishment of two separate dwarven kingdoms. The Northforge Dwarves battled the cold and the snow, as well as the myriad barbarian tribes of the mountains, before finally stumbling upon a cave with edible flora and fauna. It was a difficult time, but those battle-hardened few that remained took their freedom from the indifferent chill of the Greyghosts."

When Urik Breakhammer was separated from his brother, his fleet was washed up to the south, on a green and flourishing peninsula full of civilization. The locals offered the Dwarf-Prince-in-Exile membership in the Sholai Confederacy, as well as food and supplies for the establishment of their own kingdom. This assistance resulted in Southforge being much more quickly established, as a larger population survived to build their home. Southforge, thus, is far deeper, but with fewer surface defenses. This, of course, is even more true since the Latona Republic glassed the peninsula. The outer rock face of Southforge Bastion bears the telltale gloss of formerly molten stone that was blasted by the horrendous magicks of the Latona wizards. Following the horrific incident, Southforge has turned almost entirely inward, building deeper and deeper into the Glasspeak Mountains that house it."

When it fell in the War of Conquest, hundreds fled the destruction, followed by thousands more when they realized the Republic had no interest in garrisoning the blasted shell of the Fort. Its battered walls and shattered fortifications were silent. For a while. Now, Sir Throck, Knight of the Ashen Star, a death knight of the former Confederacy, has risen again to continue the war his people lost some seventy years ago. He and his risen soldiers are rebuilding Fort Underfell once more, and the dark shadows cast from the damned keep are beginning to reach up into civilized lands.

The chalk is never far below the grass that covers the mound, and it shines in the right light, sun or moon. Atop the mound is a rudimentary fort surrounded by a huge circular ditch edged with ramparts and a viciously spiked stake-wall palisade. The combination of the mound's unnatrually steep incline, the depth of the ditch and the crude fortificaitons makes the exposed camp at the summit very difficult to take without great magic, flying mounts, or enormous siege machines. And the hill tribes haven't seen much of any of that in these uncivilized parts. Not in living memory at least. The origins of Samor's camp are lost in history. How the mound came to be so symmetrical and so steep is not known, though many will tell a story of Samor's blood pact with the long dead Lunic Druids and their use of a Great Wyrm to shape the land to their whim. The same stories unravel into wild speculation about the whereabouts of an entrance to Samor's barrow, the enormity of his house treasure grave goods, and the wicked ferocity of the Wyrm unwillingly bound to guard it's underground resting place for all eternity..."

The purpose of this citadel was to watch the eastern sea for invaders that threatened this new empire, as the atoll that it calls home is the easternmost landmass of the continent. \"The Citadel of Ash\" began as mostly a nickname but it became so popular among the troops stationed there and the local population that its original name has been lost to time. When it was constructed, the citadel was made of a brilliant white stone. Within a small amount of years it was permanently blackened by the constant ash falling upon its walls and the name has stuck through the generations. To be stationed at the citadel was perhaps the worst assignment on the entire continent as the guards were likely far away from their families in populated cities and at risk to an early death due to the constant ash, steep slopes, and occasional catastrophic eruption; but hey the view is nice! While the atoll it resides on has remained well populated and prosperous, the population of the citadel has dwindled over the years even with new governments to own it. Once it became clear that threats from the eastern sea were likely never coming, the staffing began to dwindle down to a mere handful of men. In recent years it is all but abandoned, with but a few daring climbers and explorers willing to brave the soot-covered slopes to reach the citadel. Now tales are told of dangerous beasts and merciless criminals who occupy the citadel, rather than of ever vigilant brave men. But are these tales to be believed?"

The cult's goals are mysterious, but townsfolk near the citadel sleep poorly, with twisted nightmares. The uninitiated who spend any time within the walls find themselves exhausted and slow, drifting slowly to an uneasy sleep. The dome travels, disappearing with the morning dew after a period of time, spending most of its time absorbing the other planes' dreams in the Astral Plane. In the perspective granted there, it becomes clear that the Dome is really the eye of a long dead deity of dreams and nightmares.

A generation ago, pirates were constantly raiding the up-and-coming trading port of Quintcyville, so the tower was constructed to defend the merchant fleets in the harbor and spot incoming raids on the town. Eventually, the pirates were defeated, but the town was decimated and most trade was routed through a rival port, leaving the local economy locked in recession. A kid named Tor started leading local kids up to tower to play pretend adventures against the long-gone pirates. When Tor was older, he expanded that practice taking wealthy nobles and their spoiled children for a thrilling taste of real adventure. Safe, but appealing to their vanity, they could claim to have done something noteworthy. Soon, the town's entire economy built around Tor's adventures, which was the invention of Torism. The town now features numerous overpriced inns, taverns, shows, and shops. The tower has a few harmless monsters and a few hidden surprises.

   "Name": "The Fort of Atlas",
   "Type": "Mobile Fortress",
   "Description": "The Fort of Atlas seems, initially, much like any of the others scattered across the sweeping plains of the Western lowlands. It takes a roughly rectangular shape, with a large multi-towered central superstructure rising from within forbidding, sloped walls. There is very little in the way of internal empty space, merely some relatively narrow walkways between walls and keep. The first inkling of the fortress's unusul nature might come from these; rather than being covered in grass, they are paved in the same wide dark-grey bricks as the rest of the structure. They seem just too wide for a single man to defend effectively, but awkward for two to fight side-by-side. But the men and women who inhabit here have no intention of doing any fighting themselves. Without warning, the structure trembles for a second, and then rises up before you, and begins to move. Now the defenders of this otherwise rather quiet keep become obvious; an army of golems, each half again the size of a man and with ten times the strength. Thus does the fortress appear to 'wander' across the landscape, borne upon the backs of unshakeably loyal servitude. So too do these golems serve as its defence in the castle's time of need - the numerous access points to the understory allow them to appear from any and every direction at once, quickly surprising and surrounding any attacker who thought to simply stroll in to the apparently empty grounds. These golems are also of course the main attractant for (some of the more foolish) invaders - to wrest command of such an army away from its current owners would drastically shift the balance of power, in the cut-throat military game of the lowlands."

Earth piled up on the one side creates a rise partially shielded by the spires. Sharpened stakes were driven into the earth around the rock to protect it from... gods know what. Where the trees to make the wicked spikes came from, also a mystery. It appears to be no more than a crude goblin fort except for the black stony spires which glimmer in the sun and faintly crackle in the cold dark of the plains. Broken stakes here and there would grant admittance to this weakly fortified semi-structure. But the litter of bones at the base of the stone spires attests to its ability to defend its secrets."

Castle Black Rock appears to have been made from obsidian, though few have been close enough to determine it's true make. The walls climb up dozens of feet with parapets and guard towers stationed along the perimeter. Were the fortress stationed on the ground, it would be a difficult siege, but floating in the air?

   "Type": "Dwarven Kingdom",
   "Description": "Many of the dwarven kingdoms of old collapsed millennia ago, pushing many of the stonefolk into a life above ground in the Bothvar hinterlands of the north. One of the few realms to have survived this collapse is Nchzzar, a kingdom whose name means of Polished Basalt in the old tongue. Nchzzar is all but totally alien to the surface dwarves that have permitted to visit the underground metropole. Art, philosophy, music, theology, and even politics follow unfamiliar, rigid designs emphasizing linearity and hierarchy. At its head is Sarru Enreddu XXXIV, now in the 312th year of his reign."

   "Description": "Officially known as the St. Beleth District, the waterfront slums of Thorenbergh have been known colloquially as the Shingles for the better part of a century. As the principle commercial port between Thorenberg and the Antarres, the Shingles have become a hub for the illicit trade of Raklak powder  a highly addictive substance containing traces of lich dust, Drow venom, and obsidian salt. Three gangsters control most criminal activity in the Shingles: Merewen, a half-elf who believes herself a true elf, heads the citys most proficient cutpurses and padfoots; Grokk Madfinga, a giant orc who receives instructions from Grummsch via his left pinky, who runs the protection rackets; Scarlet Vera, an elderly Tiefling lady believed to be a high-ranking member in the Guild of Rats."

One might think the trade one of lesser importance, but with the abundance of thieves, assassins, and generally unpleasant folk in the world, sometimes all one wishes is to have a thick door and a sturdy lock in their threshold. Anything involving doors and their construction can be found in Logoria, including the budding metaphysical doorwrights  mages who enchant locks, ward doors, and craft items or scrolls with embedded portal magic."

   "Name": "Mount Archos",
   "Type": "Semi-Autonomous Region",
   "Description": "A thousand shrines and monasteries dedicated to the god Pelor dot the sun-bleached face of Mount Archos. An enclave run by the Order of the Jagged Sun, Mount Archos is a holy site for many of the worlds humans, who tend towards the worship of Pelor. Officially, it is part of the Droghate of Il-Alargol, and pays a hefty church tax to its orcish overlords; despite this, the orcs tend to leave Archos to its own devices, preferring the steady stream of income to raiding along a different mountain pass. Men are generally prohibited from Mount Archos, although male pilgrims wearing a full, black veil are allowed to pray here in the company of a female companion. The monks of the Jagged Sun, all of them women or those who have given up their gender, name, and personhood to Pelor, enforce this rule strictly  visiting swift death upon those who would defy them."

   "Name": "The Rhadamanthian Throne",
   "Type": "Monolithic Structure // Adjoining valley",
   "Description": "Countless bodies in various states of decomposition encircle the Rhadamanthian Throne  a site of important ritual significance to the Thassonic people. It is a solid pillar of dark, polished jade, covered in a dizzying array of historical and religious reliefs and text, extending up nearly 100 meters. The Thassonians believe that the Throne is an extension of their death god, and that by making a pilgrimage and leaving the bodies of the dead here, their loved ones may receive a more lenient judgement of their lives. Whatever the truth of the Throne, two things are evident: the stone from which it was carved extends naturally from beneath the earth, and that it emanates intense necrotic energy. Bodies here decay far more rapidly than normally, and tend to dry out and mummify rather than dry out. Some of the richest can afford to build tombs into the surrounding valley cliffs  most simply pile the bodies at the feet of the Throne wherever there is space."

High in the foot hills, the only road to reach the Narrows leads to Narrows West; a massive dividing canyon runs between the two towns, spanned by a handful of bridges running between stone pillar 'islands'. Narrows West is a fairly idyllic farming town; everyone has plenty to eat and drink, warm shelter against the harsh winter, and are generally friendly. The apple orchards surrounding the town are bountiful year-round. Crossing the bridge, the difference is apparent; the Narrows East orchards are hard-pressed by blight and drought, and require constant tending. However, only the women and children work in the fields; the men are all pressed into the town Militia, patrolling the streets. In particular, the makeshift barricades surrounding the small glen of natural stand trees in the middle of town, which seem unnatural lively..."

   "Type": "Magically Afflicted Geography",
   "Description": "A large forested region centered around the capital of an ancient and forgotten world power, whose sudden destruction was enough to shatter both time and space both in the city and throughout the surrounding area. The geography in this region is constantly shifting through space, and often through time. These shifts generally occur imperceptibly, but they become more frequent and more obvious the closer you are to the center, where time has frozen completely around the moment of the cities destruction. Those who enter the city can move perhaps needing protection, but everything around them is frozen and colorless. Armies fill the streets, citizens fleeing and dying. In the castle may lie the source of the disruption, or something worse that spawned from it... All of this is unknown to the modern country who claims the surrounding area. For them, the Shattermap is simply a large and inconvenient mystery, one filled with strange solitary fae and small groups of outcasts and fugitives not worth chasing after. A large road through the forest is maintained using large magical anchor-stones, which absorb and trap magic surges and any fae aggressive enough to try to step onto the road. These stones are discharged (and the emerging fae dispatched) frequently at great risk and expense. Every year the king tries to discontinue this costly maintenance, but the road is used by several powerful merchant families. And so it remains, despite the occasional anchor failure and the accompanying caravans lost into the maw of the forest."

By the second week, they had determined that the gas escaping the natural vents in the mountain was flammable. By the third week, they had set up shop. Turns out, the gas provided a near infinite supply of natural heat, the mountain provided shelter, and the industry of the gnomes provided the clean conditions necessary to harvest and utilize the alchemical ingredients of the surrounding jungle. Thus, the City of Alchemy was born, and it's production inspired the vast trade networks across the southern jungles. The gasses are directed and used to heat massive vats and boiling chambers filled with various bubbling substances both magical and mundane. The entire city is kept well protected, and outsiders rarely see inside. This has led to the propagation of many mysterious rumors about the mixtures and experiments happening inside the mountain, both malicious and benign."

The Smith himself - one Pitor Longshanks - always has a kind word, and has no trouble keeping conversation if you can stand the heat of his furnace."

   "Name": "Urthgroth's Fall",
   "Type": "Battlefield",
   "Description": "In life, Urthgroth was a mighty Chieftan of the fractious Northern Warholds, renowned for his prowess with the greatspear, feared for his unwavering sense of destruction. In his final campaign, he laid waste to every village he came upon, at one point marching three days out of his way with more than a thousand Orcs to burn a coastal fishing town to the ground. In the end, he was felled by a pitchfork thrown by a desperate peasant in a wheat field, and the lingering nature of his gradual death gave him a level of retrospection he'd rarely been afforded in life. After being raised into undeath by the camp necromancer, he devoted his brief lichdom to reuniting the Orc tribes under a banner of sustainable conquest, leading to a resurgence of the empire of old."

   "Name": "Sunshale",
   "Type": "Desert Temple",
   "Description": "With deft flicks of their brooms, the lay monks sweep the encroaching desert sand out of the temple, weaving overlapping, ever-expanding concentric circles. Each monk sweeps from sunrise to sunset (or sunset to sunrise), murmuring quiet prayers throughout, pausing only at noon and midnight to take simple meals of rice porridge and steamed fish. Those who aren't sweeping sleep, pray, and participate in a simple bathing ritual in the heart of the temple. Very occasionally, a caravan of pilgrims will visit Sunshale, at which point the monks pause in their ceaseless guardianship, opening the gates that seal the cisterns buried deep beneath the sandstone foundation. The water that flows forth follows the shallow paths worn by generations of sweeping monks, and for an ephemeral moment the name of a forgotten God is carved in stone, only to sublimate in the desert wind a heartbeat later."

   "Name": "The Godslaughter / The God's Laughter",
   "Type": "Tavern",
   "Description": "Legend tells of a Paladin - stout and faithful - who fell under the spell of strong drink. His God (everyone says it's theirs) chastised him for his excess, and demanded penitence. Drunk on the spirit of the grape, the Paladin forsook his Deity, nailing his holy symbol to the lintel above the door in the alehouse he had taken as his own. From that day onward, the establishment was known as The Godslaughter, a profane challenge to any who would avenge the breaking of the sacred oath. The Paladin (if he ever existed) is long gone, but the holy symbol is supposedly there if you care to look for it. The other legend, told by the smiling woman at the end of the bar, is also of a Paladin. But rather than forsaking his oath, he traded his warhammer and golden raiment for a jug of ale and an apron. Not all souls are saved through glorious acts, she says, or through the business end of a sword. Some simply need a listening ear, a friendly smile, and a bout of honest laughter over a bit of mulled wine."

Just as many brigands, and a rapscallion or two for good measure. But the cargo she ships is honestly obtained, the captain a niece of a family of some small fortune. If you were to ply the seas from Luskan to Baldur's Gate, you'd find a dozen like her. Still, those who book passage in her cramped guests' quarters ask for her by name on the return trip. When the actuaries see her name in insurance ledgers, they give her a favorable rate. The wind blows her way more often than not, and during a storm her canvas may tear, but it's never more than an hour's work to repair it. Some credit her namesake - Wrens are known to be a favorite of Tymora, and even in the depths of winter a mating pair nest in a snarl of rope in the forward rigging."

The fountain is a place of peace and prayer. Upon stepping up to it, you can't help but feel restful. To speak in the presence of the holy waters feels sinful. Pious elves sing soft hymns or whisper prayers, their words blending with the gentle splash of water as it splashes into the Goddess's basin and overflows to the pool below."

During the Fourth Hunting, the old Empire had fallen in such disarray that no warning reached Baldrim's Vale before Westron sellswords and thugs fell upon the hold, putting the town to the torch and slaughtering those attempting to flee. The raiders carried off what dwarvish treasures survived the fire. Now, the ruins of Baldrim's Vale are a site of grim pilgrimage for dwarves seeking answers to the tragedies of their people."

Once a girl reaches the age of twenty-three years, she is given a bag of silver and is turned out to seek her fortune. Some of the \"Angels\" marry highborn clients or are kept as mistresses, some become priestesses within the temples of their favorite clients, and others go on to establish themselves as professionals (courtesans or other trades)."

The spring cascades down into a pool which has a single tree growing next to it.

Shadowrim looms over the valley to the west and has always darkened the deep vales, the short growing season allowed by the cold made even shorter by the meager amount of sun able to touch the earth each day. The folk of the vale worship Lathander, more in supplication than in gratefulness, I'd thought. Then Maura took me up to the grove. After waking in the middle of the bleedin' night, she urged me on up rock faces near vertical at times. Just before dawn we came to a breakaway near the top of the face. Inside was open to the sky, with a tiny grove of plants and trees surrounding a wide flat bench. I sat with her on the flat stone in among the grasses. She pointed out through the hole we'd crawled through, and as I looked, the sun rose over the pass between the Eastrun range and Gauntrym's dagger. It shone on our faces like the gods' love itself. It would be an hour before sun touched the town below, but for that time, we bathed in the glorious light."

With renewed vigor the kingdom rallyed and charged, regaining their land, and slowly over many centuries the land healed.

But the actual heart of the tavern is hidden deep beneath the ground: the Blood Pit. An ancient arena of fighters long dead and champions long forgotten, fighting for glory, for gold and for faith.

The barbarians noted that the library was barricaded, and decided to set about destroying the rest of the town. They saved the library for last. Using great battering rams, they finally breached the front doors, and were greeted by an army of undead instead of scared library staff. Caught off guard, the barbarians were slaughtered to the last one. The library staff knew that the barbarians would breach the library eventually, and they would be no match for the barbarian horde. So, they paid the ultimate price to protect the library, by using a dark ceremony contained within one of the special books they kept off display and locked away in their vaults, they turned themselves into undead creatures whose sole mission is to protect their precious library. So, the library still stands, it's guardians being unable to be completely destroyed until the library itself is, but the library will not fall while they stand guard, and so they will guard it until the end of time."

Recently, however, an enterprising group of former highwaymen (who prefer the terms 'mercenaries' or 'sellspears') have occupied the old outbuildings and walls of the fortress, doing their best to make it somewhat presentable again. They're friendly enough to outsiders, and seem on guarded but cordial terms with the goatherds and herb-gatherers that roam the steep hills above the keep. But when pressed about why they've taken up in the old fortress, or who employs them and pays for the growing supply of provisions and weapons, the mercenaries are carefully reticent."

On the wall above the till, the cleaver he supposedly carried into battle hangs from a bent nail, and when the draft kicks up from the harbor, it creaks back and forth in a rusty arc. What's strange is that there doesn't seem to be a new proprietor; the old woman who slowly wraps headless fish in brown paper certainly isn't one, nor the acne-scarred youth who sweeps the floor. Most don't seem to care, though - you can get things at the Fox that you can't get elsewhere, and they're always willing to buy low-risk merchandise. In the rare case that the constabulary come sniffing, The Old Proprietor's reputation (and a few silver) is almost always enough to send their search elsewhere."

He rarely sells the stuff that comes into his shop directly, but his services are worth what he charges to hold things while the heat after a heist cools off. For a considerably more, he'll even orchestrate a delivery of some \"finished\" barrels, allowing thieves to get their goods out of town without attracting attention from the constabulary."

There are rumours, however, on what happens past the twilight hours, when most have left for their homes. A few new patrons stay behind, lured by the drink and other inviting pleasures.

   "Type": "Male Human Commoner",
   "Description": "John constantly feels like the background character of a good book. His best friends Rydgar and Thorgrin the God Slayer seem exciting, living adventurous lives. In comparison, he's content with the simple 9-5 bustle of his medium sized town, his average home, and his hobbies. He collects coins of historical value, and has a large collection that he's quite proud of. John is so normal that he almost feels out of place. But then, how normal can he be? If normal is a barbarian devil killer, then isn't John abnormal? But that doesn't seem right. He is normal, it's the world that's strange! John wrestles with these thoughts often."

   "Type": "Female Half-Elf Journalist",
   "Description": "Journalism isn't exactly the most respected career paths in the world, but it's exciting. Mepis got her start writing for The Copper Pape writing about the unimportant nonsense of small town life such as which blacksmith was hammering who's codpieces. She caught a big break after securing an exclusive interview with Pelor, somewhat breaching her ethics policies by bribing him with the famous muffins of a local chef Russel Folnhir. She's now a columnist for The Astral Quill, and has been trying to secure an interview with someone that will take her career to the next level."

   "Description": "Eubor was once a person of some description, turned undead by some necromancer of some other description. He doesn't care for the particulars. Upon being raised, Eubor found that being an undead minion wasn't for him so he left to pursue other options. He now makes a living by taking weapons from dungeons, battlefields, etc and selling them. It's not a noble living, nor a living at all for Eubor, but it occupies eternity."

   "Name": "Hirai Doyle",
   "Type": "Male Child Detective?",
   "Description": "Hirai is a child who calls himself a detective, and seems to possess intelligence and skills unlike any child should have. He also looks remarkably similar to a teenage detective from the area who went missing the same day the boy appeared, though with some glasses. This is of course just a coincidence, obviously. He frequently gets into dangerous situations, left to save the day using various gadgets created for him by his elderly gnome friend, Instructor Christie Herschel."
 },
 {
   "Name": "Daven Frealor",
   "Type": "Male Human Actor",
   "Description": "Daven is an actor, that much is simple. His real last name is Radtaie, but he changed it as there was already an actor named Daven Radtaie and there are rules to this business. He's considered semi-famous, holding a lot of minor roles in the big plays and some major roles in the smaller ones. His upcoming gig, standing in for a larger actor who quit acting to pursue a career in haberdashing, could be what he needs to break into the big leagues. His acting's fine, but he's just a bit too dramatic at times. If you want more detail, Mepis Soutan once reviewed his performance in Undeath of a Salesman."

   "Description": "Pip and Dot are male and female, respectfully, and are identical twins. As kids it was cute, but as they grew older their interests diverged and now they just get on each other's nerves. Pip is an enchanter, and Dot is a ranger. Both are highly respected by those around them, and both are proper and well mannered. Put them together and they argue like children. Without having talked to each other in years, they each met and married one of a set of twins, Tim and Tammy, with similar circumstances and none of the four knowing anything about the situation. Coincidentally, Pip and Dot's older brother Jon is good friends with Tim and Tammy's older sister Jane, having met outside the situation. That first family reunion was a confusing one."

   "Type": "Male Human Lord",
   "Description": "As corrupt as they come, Lord Fiermann sees himself a strong and capable man, though in fact his strength comes from his wife and her family, whose ambition far outstrips his. He frequently raises taxes to support his wife's \"projects\", and turns a blind eye to the numerous missing villagers who seem to wind up in his dungeons.

   "Name": "Father Osmund",
   "Type": "Male Human Cleric (War Domain)",
   "Description": "Old Father Osmund is a devout racist. Though he outwardly strives to \"better the world\", he is zealous to the point of fanaticism. He can be found wherever there is a human lord looking to stamp out a local non-human community, or otherwise spends his time persecuting non-human members of society. He seeds rumours, sometimes even planting incriminating evidence in dwellings, before offering to be the one to deal with them once the mob is roused."

She's on the run now, after that time she agreed to help deal with a ghost in the town cemetery, only to accidentally disturb all the other resting souls into haunting the town. When she reported to the council, so deep was her anxiety that her wild magic flared once again, and now none of them can talk, except to make farm animal noises. The price on her head is quite large these days."

There have only been two occasions where she has spoken, and the persons to which she spoke became heroes of legend. No town has ever survived longer than 24 hours after she appears there. Perhaps she is the cause, or merely a warning?"

Small and pale and a great desire to be evil. Sometimes sides with good for his own later benefit. Wanted nothing more than to become a Lich god. Hated good Necromancers more than anything in the world. Hated his father for cruel magical experiments. VERY strong hatred of anything evil. Able to detect alignments, worshiped a troll god. Used a sword that was too big for him and was way smarter than him. After his people were killed he was raised from infancy by a gang of human thieves. Believed himself for a long time to be human, thinks everyone sees him as human. He often thinks he needs to explain to people that he isnt human. Because he was raised by humans he behaves like a human and not an elf. Mildly racist against any other race. See's Tengu as inherintly superior. Loves shiny things. Makes no bones about using other races for his own benefit. This is all I have time for. Id love to do more but maybe Ill comment again later if I can."

   "Type": "Male Human Wizard",
   "Description": "Keranth is about 68 years old, has a heavily lined face and long white hair and a short beard. He tells people this: He has spent the majority of his life on purely theoretical studies of the arcane, and has recently sold his house to go travelling. The truth is this: He is a necromancer, whose spellbook is his own flesh. Spells are tattooed onto his body using the blood of innocents as ink. The main hint of this is that he does not have a spellbook. He is a generally kindly fellow with a cheerful attitude to life, whenever in company."

   "Name": "Jeorg Spravahich",
   "Type": "Male Orc Weaponsmith",
   "Description": "Some people, upon entering the weaponsmiths trade, settle for reliability and a steady income by manufacturing swords, axes, shields, the usual. Not Jeorg. Jeorg specialises in experimental seige weaponry, with emphasis on \"mental\". Ballistae which fire smaller ballistae, giant crossbows which fire metal shrapnel in almost every direction, trebuchets with a range of several kilometers but fall apart every time you fire them, he makes them all. And as he watches the test-shots, he laughs a deep hearty laugh that hints at the insanity within. (Based on this guy.)"

 {
   "Name": "Yuguhhurukk Rachhanahhach",
   "Type": "Male Gnome Barbarian",
   "Description": "It is not exactly certain that his name really is \"Yuguhhurukk Rachhanahhach\", everyone simply assumes that it is because that is what he introduces himself as. His speech is distorted, however, by the ritual piercings of a member of his tribe who is on a Blood Quest. This piercing takes the form of a relatively large iron bar passing through both cheeks, impaling the tounge in passing, with symbols of his god on the end of each bar, holding it in place. He also abhors writing, making communication all but impossible. He has settled in the countryside far from his homeland, as some unknown incident has erased his memory of the details of Blood Quest, he only remembers that he is on one, and that the bar may not be removed before it is complete. His speech is incomprehensible. For example, \"Can you direct me to the nearest tavern?\" becomes \"Chlaag urghh urechh ee oo aa eggaech aggerrr?\""

   "Name": "Kimberly Parish",
   "Type": "Female Vampire Innkeeper",
   "Description": "Kimberly tends a bar in a dive town, and yet somehow the bar patrons are unusually quiet and docile once through the doors. Unlike any other inn in town, disputes are settled calmly, fights are unheard of, and lewd behaviour is nonexistent. This may have something to do with the covered bite marks on the patrons shoulders, and what may be hidden behind the scarf Kimberly keeps wrapped around her neck."

   "Description": "Maggie is a Half-Elf. She understands that there are those in this world who do not take kindly to species-mixing. Her brother had warned her as much before he was captured in a raid when they were young. She has cut off the points to her ears, takes in the sun as much as she can, and plays the fool when she hears Elvish being spoken. She dresses herself in Human clothing, and has stopped practising any customs from her childhood. She has been put in charge of the messenger-pigeons for the Baron, and prays that one day she finds Elves contacting him, so she may try to find a home with people more accepting."

 {
   "Name": "Khyban",
   "Type": "Female Dragonborn General",
   "Description": "Khyban was never meant to become a General. She had six brothers, all of them strong and capable of command. It was Khyban's lot to work with potions, or inter-clan diplomacy, or to help raise the younglings of her brothers. Dragonborn clans don't often look kindly on those who reject the role given to them. But when a Dragonborn returns home one night displaying the severed head of a Hill Giant, before they have even fully reached adulthood, it is impossible to ignore them. Khyban knows how to reward captains and soldiers who please her in battle. Displeasing Khyban rarely happens now."

Sir Annory has notoriously been part of battles that were already largely won, or were an easy victory. He has always requested to be stationed near less-troublesome areas. However, none of this works to lessen his arrogance, and he will inflate his achievements in battle whenever his honour is questioned."

 {
   "Name": "Darber Claytop",
   "Type": "Male Dwarf Diplomat",
   "Description": "Darber is perhaps the only famous Dwarf in the kingdom who didn't earn such fame with a weapon. His crowning achievement thus far has been his negotiations with Karg the Big. Karg was an Orc chieftan who had grown his war pack large enough to threaten the city. However, using his snakelike tongue, Darber was able to stave off the Orc invasion for four full days; enough time for reinforcement cavalry to arrive and smash the Orc host. Darber now works within the city as a highly-respected ambassador."

Her success with ship-raiding has been such that the sea provides all the treasure she needs. She leads her crew of Halflings in the long, blue-painted ship known as the Cerulean Shadow. If Bobbla wishes to remain unseen in a shadow, she will do so. If she desires that her ship remain unseen in broad daylight, it too will do so. No non-Halfling have ever survived once they step on Bobbla's ship, so the secret to the boat's stealth remains a mystery."

Her predictions have saved her clan innumerable times, and for this she has been treated with great reverence within her clan.

For this, the Goblins kneeled to her and proclaimed her the new chieftan. For the past two years, Elena has led raids with her ever-growing Goblin clan on her former king's outposts for revenge of his inaction."

Once was nearly killed by an Owlbear. Well known in his small town for bringing home large game from hunts with expert killing blows. Andre is a 1/10 ugly creepy dude with a smoking hot 10/10 wife. He was given the ironic nickname \"Handsome\" after he married his extremely attractive and loyal wife who is beloved by the town. Unknown to the townsfolk Andre made a pact to sell his soul to a demon when he was young in order to make his high school crush fall in love with him forever. (In my game he was a warlock but he doesn't have to be) He was an adventurer for several years, and uses the money he earned to make a living as a patron of local sculptors, masons and painters, paying their living expenses for an extortionate proportion of the profits from their work."

Eloranae has been walking to the ends of the world, looking for what few wood elves remain. She is the last of her house and carries an immense sorrow behind her eyes.

   "Type": "Male Wood Elf Scout",
   "Description": "The blonde elf tosses his hair over his shoulder and stifles his laugh long enough to take a swallow of wine from the skin that hangs about his neck. When set on a task, Corian will carry it out with unerring determination; his family sometimes jokingly chide him as \"Half-Elven,\" suggesting he may carry the blood of men within him. When not on a specific mission, Corian is a merry companion; keeping company mostly with men and halflings in the travelers' camps in the forest or at the travelers' along the road. His family, especially his brother, thinks Corian is a troublemaker; the truth is Corian feels the sadness and loss that others do, perhaps more sharply, and he drinks and makes-merry so as not to be consumed by the gloom."

   "Type": "Male Wood Elf King",

Possessing no magical gifts of his own, he is especially jealous and suspicious of spellcasters or those who carry items of great magical power with them."

In reality he uses several enchanted items of clothing and jewellery to draw in and swindle the patrons of small town taverns, big city bars and everywhere in between. A 16 year old Changeling girl making the most out of her natural shape changing abilities and avoiding the mistrust most people have of her people.

 {
   "Name": "Thenmozhibe",
   "Type": "Female tiefling moneylender",
   "Description": "Relatively tall with a wiry build, and no noticeable hair. Carries a many-notched steel staff of exactly five feet that she uses for taking measurements. Spends a month at a time inspecting roads and bridges and recommending changes around a town that hires her before moving on. Understands several languages but primarily speaks Dwarven in conversations with herself and others. His nose makes a faint whistling noise when he talks. Spends his evenings cleaning tables at a friend's inn in exchange for a room. Average height, broad shoulders, and shaved head with a large greying mustache. Has substantial savings that he intends to put toward building a house in the woods nearby. Twice married to human men less than half her age and twice widowed from duels in her honor. Wears secondhand clothes and jewelry from whichever town she last visited, to be traded in or sold for replacements in her current town. Talented flutist who takes pride in recognizing and developing the musical talents of those around her. Long brown hair, green eyes, and a permanently seductive expression. Dull-witted but friendly, and loyal to his friends and employers (in that order). Unable to speak any language except rudimentary Dwarven, though he understands orders as long as they are in Dwarven. His face is a misshapen mess of scars and broken bones that he has accumulated over the years, and his unkempt red beard has had chunks torn out of it. He is independently wealthy and spends coin generously, though nobody knows where or how he has amassed such a fortune. Short brown hair, a hawkish nose, and a large pair of canine teeth jutting up from her lower jaw make up an unusual visage, if not a particularly ugly one. She does not boast many clients, but those that pay will pay very well for her services - and highly recommend \"that thing she does with her teeth.\" Offers a money-back guarantee if clients leave unsatisfied, which no one has yet been able (or willing) to claim. Spends most of her free time passing by the homes of the nobility, admiring their gardens. Straight black horns follow his thin white hair back behind his head; rheumy brown eyes sit above a thin-lipped business smile. A team of apprentices run the day-to-day operations while he sits in the back of his shop, dreaming up and sketching fashion ideas. When a client of sufficient value enters, he becomes as authoritative and demanding as any tyrant, and will often simply forbid a troublesome client from speaking altogether; it is a testament to his prowess that business does not waver. He holidays with his paramour among the nobility once each year, whose identity he keeps secret largely for his own sake. Standing six feet even, Sash is heavily muscled and deceptively quick; her hair is tied back and she has silver tattoos over her arms and legs that stand out in stark contrast to her ebony skin. She's a bouncer for a tavern that sees very little business during the day, but much more when she's managing the tavern's fight pit after midnight. She regularly takes a week off to visit her family out of town, though once in a blue moon she'll take one of her many challengers up on their offer for a fight in the pit. Her tattoos are in Orcish - what she thinks says \"Swiftness,\" \"Vengeance,\" \"Fury,\" and \"Resolve\" actually says \"Fruit,\" \"Southeast,\" \"Brownly,\" and \"Dwwabmmh.\" Soft white scales run from the crown of his head and flare out all the way down his spine, while the rest of him covered in smooth, leathery grey skin. At his full height, he is a scale under six feet tall, with the tendency to crouch or bow his head to better hear those smaller than him. While young for his kind, he is very sickly; on any given day he might be sweating or coughing heavily, and he usually sounds exhausted. On rare occasions (months apart), he feels genuinely, truly good for days at a time, during which he shuts himself in his tiny home and works non-stop as his cultured colleagues await the results with baited breath. Short and stocky frame, with asymmetrical, broken brown horns that have been filed smooth. She can be very abrasive, and speaks openly about her distaste for her clients, her hired thugs, and the business of moneylending. She balks at spending money herself, though she is quick to jump on a deal if she's certain she can turn it over in her favor quickly. She refuses to deal in silver pieces, in an often futile attempt to invoke her demonic heritage for leverage."

She avoid human contact most of the time but some days she visits the town of Vreedam, where she tends to the sick and poor.

Whenever she goes throught the streets there is allways a swarm or urchins surrounding her and she allways has some goodberries to spare. Her hair has turned the colour of sea foam and her sky blue skin has as many wrinkels as the sea during a storm, her back isn't what it used to be either so she is seldom seen without the driftwood staff she uses for walking. But her eyes are still the same as in her youth. Big eyes that catch the light and reflect it like a mountain lake on a windless day. Yet also deep and blue like the sea. Eyes that you could loose yourself in and drown. And many a man did back in the days. The old folk can sometimes tell of a time where every man was trying to court the mysterious lady of the shore.

In one word, he was hot. The Ocean Dawn hailed from Brangha, a big trading city in the far west. She was carring fruit, spices and silk of sorts people in Vreedam had never seen. The Ocean Dawn stayed in harbour for 3 weeks. Quite a long time. Why you ask? To celebrate the Dawns arrival the major decided to hold a massive party, it doesn't happen every day (or even year) that a ship from this far west found it's way to Vreedam after all. There was music and dance, food and alcohol, laughter and cheering. And at the center of it all was Kareem. Allways surounded by a flock of young woman, first dancing with this one, then with that one. Then he was gone. As if by magic. Which in a magic rich world like this seems actually quite likely ;) You see Kareem isn't actually quite the party type, while he loves to dance he doesn't like big crowds. He is honestly a bit of a loner. And so it came that on this fatefull night an again visible Kareem decided to take a stroll along the beach. And it was here, where the Vree joins the Great Green Sea that he met her. Deep Blue hair blowing in the ocean breeze, looking out towards the sea with eyes that reflected the moon and the stars. Their eyes met and Kareem could feel his heart skip a beat. The next day some folk reported seeing two figures dancing on the waves, only their silhouettes visible against the morning sun rising from the ocean. The Ocean Dawn left 3 weeks later, to travel to the Small Green Sea and sell the rest of it's wares and return a few weeks later to Vreedom to let of a single person and then travel back west to Brangha where it would have to find a new captain. This was the last anyone saw of the Oceans Dawn for 35 years."

She laughs, she cries, she tells them she'll be flogged if she doesn't get the answers she needs. Whatever works. When she can, she walks behind them unseen, the soles of her boots whispering on the flagstones of her clean, spare chambers. Just as with any other tool, she uses violence sparingly and judicially... but first, if nothing else works, she steps from the shadows and pulls the hood from her head.

Instead, he wears finely tailored clothes, tasteful yet expensive jewelry, and personally oversees all of the kingdom's dealings with adventurers and would-be heroes. Having retired from adventuring himself at the ripe old age of 45, his dark hair (with gray wingtips, lovingly maintained) and trained grey eyes are a fixture around the palace. He prefers to do things the easy way, rather than the way that involves copious amounts of explosions, but make no mistake: he isn't called the Mage Knight of Eastmark for no reason."

Unfortunately for them, they are asking the wrong question. The right question: How good does Dame Elmeara have to be to come out of every fight with immaculate armor? The right answer: Very, very good."

For every noble who travels in an open carriage through a city filled with tall buildings, there are five more who don't eat their breakfast until their entire court has a bite first. And yet, a select few kingslayers still manage to turn a profit. Alexei van Valerya knows the art of killing important people better than any other bodyguard, mostly because up until a few years ago, he was on the side of the artists. The ex-assassin-turned-security-chief cuts an unassuming figure; at 5'10 he's not the tallest, and at 160 pounds he's not the bulkiest. What he is, is effective. From his swept-back black horns to his toes, Alexei is all business. Tales around the palace say that he personally kills at least one foreign spy before breakfast, and two before lunch. He fights with his bare hands, or with garrote wire, or with long, ten-inch dirks that he wears on his back, and when he does, he is completely silent."

His eyes are wide, and his head's got patches of hair all about it in between the patches that have either fallen out or been ripped out.

Still, he held the knife, hilt against the body's back, a few more seconds until he was sure it was only his own breath rasping in the dark cellar. \"Balch, you're getting sloppy,\" he muttered to himself as he willed his left hand to release the quarry's horn and slowly withdraw the ten inch dirk. The darkened skin of the tiefling on the floor seemed to go ashy in the inky black pool of its own blood. He'd earned this bounty, but at what cost? Licking his lips unconsciously, he knew the self-flagellation tonight would be particularly intense."

   "Name": "Folding Bridge",
   "Type": "Better than nothing magic items",
   "Description": "This item looks like an unassuming 8 ft. plank of lumber, but close examination of the ends reveals seams in the wood. The seams can be pulled apart to unfold the plank to form a solid bridge of any of the following sizes: It takes a full round to unfold the bridge from one size to the next. It can be folded back up to its portable size at the same rate. Once unfolded, the bridge can be placed across any gap and holds in place without apparent support. It can withstand up to 40,000 pounds in weight; any excess weight causes the bridge to break, permanently destroying it. The bridge can be easily be lifted at either end. Regardless of size the bridge itself always weighs the same as it does in its plank form (15 lb.) plus the weight of whatever is currently atop it. The collapsible bridge can be attuned to a particular person. Once attuned, only that person may unfold or fold the bridge, until it is attuned to someone else. Furthermore, only the person so attuned can lift the bridge once placed."

If the larger skull lid is removed, after thirty seconds of inflation a human skeleton appears in a free space adjacent to the box. The skeleton is genuine and not in itself magical. If the smaller skull lid is removed, inflation takes twenty seconds and a halfling skeleton appears instead. The box can create one inflatable skeleton per day. If a skeleton is created while another exists, the first crumbles to dust. Perfect for causing distractions, framing enemies, and entertaining at children's parties."

This is intended to be something that you might even make (from cheap dice and blu-tak, perhaps?) and hand to the player who loots it. It will appear, in-game, to be a simple object, albeit one with a faintly magical aura. Once attuned to the object, the character learns that they can call on its power when in need. I called \"meta-magic item\" because it's sort of in the boundary between player and character, if that makes any sense."

The axe itself has a bad history of betrayal and vengeance which lead to it gaining powers. The axe was originally forged by an elven smith living in a human city along with other weapons. The smith was to forge \"100 pounds of good steel\" to pay off his gambling debt. The holder of said debt found many \"problems\" with the expertly crafted steel and kept the elf in servitude for months after the debt was paid. The next instance of betrayal was against the man holding the debt, though he may have deserved it the betrayer had no way of knowing that. A half elf merchant and his men bought the steel in bulk all of the elves work after the forgemaster had been freed. They paid in enchanted copper coins, The holder of the dept was hanged when he paid his taxes in fake gold coins. The Half elf and his men traveled south hoping to trade their ill gotten gains and found the road had been blocked by a tribe of gnolls. A gnome and his band offered to help but only if he got half payment now and the other half when the job was done. This did not end well for the half elf whom paid in a crate of his wares. The gnome returned and said the road was safe and his men would guard the caravan until it reached the town past the plains. He was lying of course and had given the gnolls the crate of weapons in exchange for their help slaughtering the half elf and his men. The gnolls promised the gnome the wealth in exchange for the weapons. They lied too. The gnolls left the scene with all of it including the weapon that would later be called the Axe of the Betrayed. The gnolls lived in a strict matriarchy and the gnoll whom acquired the axe was the brother of the reigning matriarch. Given only select females were allowed to breed any offspring from any non sanctioned unions would be eliminated. A warrior female and the brother to the chief had one such union. He promised to keep the child safe. His weak will saw that the matriarch found out about the child and forced her brother to accompany her as she tracked the mother down. She ran for days but eventually the matriarch and her pathetic sibling caught up with her. On the rocky plains she gave her child to a band of adventurers moments before the Axe of the Betrayed was thrown into her back by her former lover. She died from the wound but not before seeing the confused half orc hand her child over to the matriarch. She watched as it was killed. The axe was left in her back but she would not stay dead. She arose as a Revenant the next night and buried her pup properly. Using her new undead powers the gnoll mother destroyed her former tribe and tracked the band of adventurers in the southern swamps. She was destroyed and her axe taken. Though she still seeks vengeance the Axe has found new owners. The axe itself is magical now and where as it was used to cause great suffering and betrayal the powers that inhabit it seek to right wrongs instead. The axe becomes a +1 weapon against any foe who has attacked a companion of its wielder. This bonus also is gained if the wielder has seen the target harm an innocent. The axe deals 2d12 instead of 1d12 if a companion is reduced to 0 hit points but only on the wielders next turn and on the target causing the damage. (once per turn) If the wielder is seeking to bring justice to a betrayer the axes power truly shines. If the wielder can recount aloud the betrayal the target has caused in combat the next hit the axe lands on the target is automatically a critical."

When kept most, the outer layer of a ball of the powder will become crusted and hard. When consequently broken open against a solid surface, the resulting explosion created by the expanding and combusting powder will deal mainly force damage to all in the area. Due to the difficulty of harvesting and storing the powder safely the select few that purchase it do so at a high price. While unconfirmed, several wizards have stated that using the powder as the material component for the \"fireball\" spell is not only possible, but also greatly enhances it's effects."

Away from the rack the jar is completely ordinary, it is merely a receptacle for the magic of the rack. To use the power of the spice rack, the lid of the jar must be removed and any spice or edible herb named. The jar immediately fills with the named flavouring. The contents are enough to flavour a single meal for up to ten people. Naming a second spice or herb replaces the contents. Spices and herbs already named can be re-summoned but the amount in the jar will be reduced by the amount previously used. The capacity of the jar for each spice or herb refills after a long rest. No matter the amount used, no flavouring created by the spice rack has the capacity to poison, even if it normally would when ingested in large doses. The spice rack simply cannot create any herb which is inedible. A person may be attuned to this item; if so attuned they can use the spice rack for its real purpose: effectively, an innocuous poisoner's kit. The attuned rack will happily create poisonous herbs for its owner, and any edible herb that is actually poisonous in high doses is now no longer safe when ingested in large amounts."

The boots do not dirty from the dust of the road, nor do they ever seem to wear out. However, before he gave the boots to Adele, Corneli's jealous rival, the Enchanter Aneu, cursed them with a dread bewitchment. Whenever the wearer attempts to move at a faster pace than a walk, the buckles will come unclasped, causing them to stumble and fall. Corneli - who knew nothing of the curse - gave the boots to Adele on the day of her departure. The two lovers took a bit too long saying their goodbyes, and so she was forced to hurry to catch up with the other pilgrims. As she ran across the Red River Bridge, Aneu's enchantment took effect, and she fell off into the water and drowned. Corneli was heartbroken, and buried Adele's body by the bridge where she died. He never forgave himself for what he thought was his own failure. He threw the boots into the river, and vowed to never work magic ever again."

If all charges on the staff are expended then it shatters and it is destroyed at all points in its timeline, which is convoluted and strange, it reforms three months later at all points along its timeline. Due to the convoluted nature of time with the staff there may be multiple versions of the staff in existence at the same time, which will instantly shatter if touched together. In order to permanently destroy the staff some way must be found to seclude two of them from the stream of time and then touch them together.

Unfortunately, it describes the practices for a faith other than your own. If you have this book on hand when you are about to perform one of these rituals, you can spend 10 minutes browsing the book. After which, you roll a d20.

   "Name": "Ring of Ceremony Storing",
   "Type": "Magical Ring",
   "Description": "This ring functions much like a Ring of Storing, but instead of magically storing and recalling a weapon, you instead store the items (ie, candles, censer, small altar, etc.) needed for a specific ceremony (ie, marriage, funeral, bar mitzvah, etc.), and can summon them at a moments notice. The ring is reusable and can store the ceremonial items again after the ceremony is completed. Items stored in the ring stay in the ring even when the ring is removed, so a single priest may carry a number of these rings, one for each ceremony they feel they may have to perform during their journeys. So, if one of these rings is found in a  or on a dead body, there is a good chance there may already be ceremonial items stored within. But, fair warning, these rings can be used by priests of any belief (good, neutral, evil.), so activating this ring may cause the wearer to find themselves surrounded with unholy or holy items, which could be detrimental to one's health if of an opposing belief."

So, the Indestructible Prayer Book was created to help traveling clerics, healers, and other holy types not have to worry about such things. The book is waterproof, flameproof, and tear proof. And the pages are illuminated with a soft light, so one could even read the book in the darkest of places. Plus, as an added bonus, if you tell it what prayer you're looking for specifically. it will open to that prayer by itself, so you don't have to fumble with pages while performing a ceremony. Admittedly these books are expensive, which is why they are usually reserved for the upper echelons of the church, but they are sometimes gifted to special priests as rewards for some great deed performed for the church."

   "Name": "The God Text",
   "Type": "their",
   "Description": "On the side of a mountain is a large sheer flat section, atop a treacherous scree slope. Whether the side of the mountain fell long ago and was carved later or, as legends suggest, the rock fell revealing the already existing words underneath, is unknown. The letters are five feet hight, carved the length of a tall man's arm into the rock, and are astoundingly smooth. The nesting birds that use every crook and crevice in the rock for miles around won't go anywhere near the words. The language is unknown. The letters are regular and square, grouped into words that are only ever four, eight, or sixteen letters long. The number of letters is disputed; some scholars classify subtle differences between carvings as being entirely different letters, others simply as variations. The most common counts are eighteen and thirty-two. Half of the bottom sixteen lines of text are taken up with a single, gigantic, four-letter word, carved twice as deep into the rock as the other letters. There are scrolls of the God Text found all over. They are often kept in ornately decorated scroll-cases made of precious metals. The scrolls themselves can be written on thin gold or silver foils. The letters might be embossed, or actually punched out. The accuracy of the transcription seems to change the effect it has on readers. Reading a copy of the God Text can lead people to drop everything in their lives and head towards the site of the original. Wizards studying the God Text have created new spells of astounding power and versatility. Adventurers have decoded the Text as a map several times, leading to vastly far-flung places. Strangely, each time a powerful artefact of some kind has been found. One wizard claimed he was going to use the God Text as the basis for a Golem, but nothing has been heard from him, or his city, since then."

The High Priestess ran off with her copy and hasn't been seen since.

Although thoroughly researched, the book suspiciously goes on at great length about one Aloysius Fernangeles Compodius VII, describing his musical style in flattering, flowery language. Also suspiciously, one of the most popular musicians in the region is consistently referred to as \"The Drunk,\" and his musical style described as \"crude fare for the masses.\""

Despite these promises, the pamphlet teaches absolutely nothing that's magical in nature; rather, the final six pages are merely a hastily written list of general (and mundane) housekeeping tips, such as \"Sweep your entranceway daily, to keep dirt from getting tracked about the house.\" Several of the tips are duplicates, as well; the total number of unique tips is actually closer to eighty."

   "Description": "It all started with an Elven wit, who on a lark one day, took a book full of blank pages, and painted on the cover \"The Book of Fine Dwarven Poetry\", and displayed in on his mantle at home. A local bookseller was in the home one day and noticed the book, and thought that would be a fine way to sell some blank books to folks. A lot of elves loved the joke, and bought numerous copies to give to friends and family. Sure enough though, Dwarves visiting the city were not as happy with the book, and some decided to return the favor, and so they created their own blank paged book, called the \"Book of Fine Elven Craftsmanship.\" The Elves got quite insulted, and came out with a new blank paged book called the \"Book of Fine and Attractive Dwarven Women.\" Needless to say, other titles ensued in this war of blank paged books, with titles like \"Book of Fine and Non-Effeminate Elven Men\", \"Book of Fine and Bathed Dwarven Men\", \"Book of Fine and Non-Sheep Buggering Elves\", etc. After a few months, the war mercifully ground to an end, as both sides moved on to weightier issues. But, many of those blank paged tomes are still out there."

   "Description": "The first twenty pages or so of this thin folio feature a selection of drawings, essays, and descriptions on and of the large saltwater tortoises that were once proliferant around the subtropical islands of the south. The following pages, however, seem to be written by a different hand, and while at first they follow the same structure, cryptic notes in the margins begin to overtake the text and illustrations, until they make up the entirety of the pages near the end of the book. The meaning of the notes - which largely consist of long strings of seemingly nonsense words - has been rigorously debated within the scholarly community, but at least four disparate religions and cults have been founded based on various interpretations of the text. Notably, all agree that the last page - which is naught but a tangle of scribbled, barely legible mass of ink - depicts the same thing; the face of a long dead God."

The description of a ring meant to imbue the element of fire to the wearer seems to stand out as the page has been dog-eared and seems worn. Another remarkable find is near the end of the book. It's a plain bone wand that is described as having \"petty and amateurish effects of prestidigitation and minor illusions,\" but off to the side, written in what seems to be a hastily scrawled ink, is the phrase \"death conquers all.\""

Normally, the face's eyes and mouth are closed, but when Bubistai commanded it, the eyes would open and the mouth would start reciting something. But, it can only recite things written within it's pages, so Bubistai planned to write many important and significant things within it. And indeed, he wrote magic thesises, spell research notes, and historical facts about his life within it's covers. But, unfortunately he died within a couple years of creating the book, and it fell into the hands of his apprentice, who quickly started filling the book with all sorts of nonsense, such as limericks, erotic poems, and the occasional shopping list.

   "Description": "Describing the Book of Night is difficult, in no small part because looking directly at the artifact is nearly impossible. Casual glances slide straight over the Book; it is somewhat possible to get an understanding of what it looks like merely through peripheral vision, but only a concerted effort of extreme willpower can overcome this particular attribute. Once the witness' will has been asserted, however, the Book's appearance truly manifests itself. The cover is unmarked and black, neither matte nor glossy; simply black. The surface is, furthermore, adorned with silver points of varying size. Should one attempt to move the Book, they will notice that these silver markings move--or, rather, remain fixed relative to the position of the Book. When they reach the edge of the cover, they vanish, and are replaced by others that appear on the opposite edge. A particularly astute observer will note that, when held aloft and compared to the night sky, the markings match the positions of visible stars."

The bark is from no tree that yet lives; druidic lore and wizardly knowledge alike fail when confronted by it. The one time a Dryad was consulted, she spent the remainder of the day with bowed head, murmuring something not unlike a prayer. The writing itself is shockingly refined and crisp, despite being so old. The lettering is simultaneously foreign and familiar, with elements of most known scripts found in it somewhere. So far, only select words and phrases have been translated, mostly due to their similarity to one or more extant languages, and the translations have been rudimentary at best. The actual vocalization of this language is completely unknown."

When placed on another person's body, one who is skilled in magic can press their face into and through the surface of the peering directly into the persons soul much as one might peer into a body of water. In fact the caster cannot breath while using this scroll, so it is limited by how long the user can hold his or her breath, or by how long the person is willing to tolerate such an intrusion. When peering into another, you may see many thing: bitterness manifesting itself as an adder's bite, the true disposition of the soul that may even be a mystery to the person whom you are looking into, spirits that may be taking refuge within the person, or are perhaps there for more malign purposes. The scroll has had many names over the years, such as Ryon's Mirror, and Gorfellow's Embrace. Those who use it should be forewarned that looking directly into a person's soul in this manner could have dire effects on a person's sanity, and it has been noted that Arghul, a promising young mage drowned when he used it and found that he was looking into a truly beatific soul and lost all notion of time and perspective and even his need for air. A pity, really. So promising."

Only the most cold-hearted readers of the tome have read it without it eliciting a tear, while others are haunted by the sadness for the rest of their days by the tale. It is unknown how a sorcerer of such middling talent could have wrought such a device, and it is also unknown how many, or if in fact any of the tales told within it are true. It is also impossible to to tell with any reasonable degree of certainty how Garum met his end. It is known, however, that this was the last and most notable of his bequeathed creations."

And yet, over the years various sailors have added their own touches - a bundle of pigeon feathers tied with sinew to a thumbscrew, a rough etching of a stylized Kraken, an extra mirror.

Unfortunately, the engineers at Mr. Mizzen didn't take the typical sailor's superstitious nature into account, and the candles failed to sell well, especially after stories of 'demon ships' bathed in red, orange and green lights began to circulate. A second batch of Mate's Candle was sold, marketed with 'sailor friendly' shades of white, yellow and gold, but the damage had been done. Still, many of the candles have been repurposed by cults looking for mood lighting, watchmen in coastal cities, and thrifty students."

Regardless, most agree that the rigs' deep shale oil - shipped all along the coast in tight, cotton-wrapped bamboo casks to whoever can afford it - is some of the best on the market. Less well known is a byproduct of the drilling, flammable, dense stone known by mariners as Drowned Chull. When dried, it can be chipped, carved and shaped into pellets suitable for small cannon or flintlock longarms. While less durable than iron or lead shot, drowned shot has the advantage of being innately flammable, and has been used (with mixed effectiveness) to set sails, unwashed hair and powder stores alight."

Callus may have hoped to be brought back as a Lich, but Orcus has a sense of humour. Callus has the horrifying hunger of a ghoul. Yet he retains the intellect he had while living and has used it over centuries to amass equivalent knowledge and power to a lich - he even has managed to create his own phylactery. Callus intends to carve out an empire. The more mobile of his undead servants are sent abroad, for few living people willingly come near Valhazar these days.

He seeks to reclaim and rebuild Valhazar, with himself on the throne. But since he can't do that until Callus and his horde are removed from the ruins, Jorus was forced to investigate how to extend his own life. He has since become a lich. He is attempting to amass a large enough mercenary force to make a foray into Valhazar and slay Callus and his lieutenants - killing the undead minions is not essential to his plan, indeed he would like as many of them to survive as is possible, so he can bind them to his own rule. and may therefore seek to contract powerful heroes. He hires them through a proxy, but if he is forced to meet any hero he presents himself as an archlich (a good-aligned lich), who seeks only to undo the evils of his brother."

   "Description": "Gnomes have the quickest tongues, and his daddy taught him every dodge that the old man knew, raised him in the life, and fleecing a pigeon came as natural to him as breathing. Con-men don't last long who can't read the mood of a man, or a room, in a single glance, and violence is always the very last resort of a man who has forgotten how to use his wits. Kerblaine knows a hundred street cons, always playing the short-game, never sticking around, never appearing in the same street twice, if he can help it. His favorite dodge is to pretend to have found a lottery ticket in the street, but says he's lost his identification papers, and if the mark can go cash it for him, he'd split the winnings with him. Of course, the grifter can't let the pigeon just stroll away with a valuable ticket, so he asks for a portion of the future winnings, as a \"security bond\" (usually half, and Kerblaine generally forges tickets that pay off 50 gp, not too high to raise suspicion, and not too low as to not be worth the trouble). When the mark pays up and goes to cash in the ticket, Kerblaine disappears like smoke. Sometimes if the mark looks like he deserves it, Kerblaine will tip off the Watch about a potential con-man in the area, heading to the nearest Temple/Shrine of Luck with a phony ticket. He loves a drink and a dance with the ladies (or the men, he's not fussy), and never uses the same alias twice. He sleeps armed."

That's just his hobby though. His job is mercenary, and works for a decent wage for most of the major gangs in the area, which one depends on his seasonal mood. His whims change with the sun, but he's generally loyal for the season if paid up and treated well, as his services are in high demand.

Her specialites are gnomish and dwarven traplocks. She can get a Thunder Cutter lock (used on most of the front doors of the private estates she \"visits\") open in under 20 seconds, under 10 on a good day. She favors disarming traps to springing them, and has made a life-long study of the engineering habits of gnomes and dwarves especially, but has a working knowledge of other racial defenses as well. She loves to cook, and indulges that passion when forced into her book-seller role (a grey-haired wallflower named Erma Densmarsh who lets her 2 employees run the business, a small store called \"The Fictional Fen\" - a play on her name, and typical of the \"cutesy\" naming convention of the area). Her culinary skills are reserved primarily for human men. She spent many years being brutalized by them in various jails and prisons around the Realms and was once forced, by hunger, to partially eat a dead cellmate, a man who deserved so much more punishment than being snacked on."

Long ago in her forest, she came upon a strange, tentacled fungus that called to her in sweet whispers. When she approached it, the fungus wrapped it's tentacles around her and held her captive for years. Slowly, the fungus changed her: it twisted her form, and poisoned her mind with ugly and terrifying thoughts. Then, after a time, the grasping tentacles released her. She now roams the world, spreading deadly spores. When a creature inhales the spore, its mind rots over the course of a few hours and then it dies, only to rise as a fungal zombie. These fungal zombies rove in bands, uprooting trees and plants and pummeling living creatures, leaving a trail of destruction and decay. When one of the fungal zombies is slain, spores erupt from its corpse, thus creating more fungal zombies. By some foul craft, Malapora's mind is preserved from the rot, and, though she can't command the fungal zombies, she's quite adept at avoiding them and leading them untouched territory. She has hopes of creating a world where the body of every plant, beast, and humanoid has been reduced to a decaying mass for the cultivation of tentacled, malevolent fungus."

She was convinced that the purity of her mission could keep her from straying into evil -- and indeed she succeeded in turning back the goblins, through the use of necromancy and foul diseases. Her mission fulfilled, she fled, undying, into the remote mountains in an attempt to spare others from her evil deeds. However, over the intervening centuries, her transformation has corrupted and embittered her, and she seeks to take revenge upon those she blames for her transformation; the kingdom she once called home."

   "Name": "Roderick of Spode",
   "Description": "Roderick seems to be an ordinary historian, interested in collecting and preserving relics of previous ages -- especially now, since the spate of thefts from crypts and ruins all over the kingdom. Indeed, he will hire groups of heroes to venture into such places to secure them before the thieves get to them! He has an affable and genial manner, with a distinctive speech impediment, but this is a facade: in actual fact, he is to blame for the thefts (his concern is an act), and is seeking a particular long-lost dark artefact, for the power it can give, and to complete a certain ritual..."

How does he turn up in the most unreasonable places, and how does he survive so easily in the depths of the wilderness? Why does he never seem to change, even his clothes, and why do people always seem to forget things when they are around him? And how does he know the party's names?"

Heh... Our affairs. As if we have control over those. The rest of us are even less; we are simply an illusion. A projection of a mad overlord, to whom even your controllers must pay deference. He created us, fabrications for his sick whimsy. Every moment of your adventure since you came together, every ally and foe, every challenge you have overcome, has been naught but a game of chance. Your entire lives were dreamt up by him and his underlings. We have no will. No agency. No lives. Even the gods are but players in his minstrelsy. There is but one solution. We must sever the strings.\""

Still, his presence is feared by the wee - many a pixie has come home to find their family pinned to a hawthorn branch, their wings scattered in the underbrush below. He appears to mortals as a small bird, with grasping, long fingered hands where his feet ought to be, and his song is said to give mild indigestion to the young and weak at heart."

   "Name": "Yissik the Friendless",
   "Description": "Yissik's passion is the perversion of loyalty and the twisting of alliances. He finds the most offensive state of the mortal world is the co-operation which some foolish souls call 'natural'. Wherever mortals stand together, wherever common ground is found, wherever differences are put aside, Yissik will turn his gaze - and begin his plans. All too often they succeed as the mightiest of bonds may be broken by the simplest of whispers, if they fall in the right ears.

The necrophore used to be one of the most powerful empire on the land and ruled with an iron fist, until they declared war to the emerald dragons. Necrophores are thought by most to be just a myth, as they haven't been seen aboveground in a long while. These cunning creatures have a distinctly creepy physique, with twenty long spider-like black legs under a green reptilian torso. Their small white eyes aren't of much use and they instead rely on their bat-like ears to navigate the tunnels where they live. A few decades ago, Fzar's village was found by a scout of the emerald dragons and subsequently destroyed. Everyone in his community was murdered, including him. Fortunately for him, he was a fervent cleric of one of the gods of death, which granted him a new life and some powerful necromancy abilities. In exchange, he has to garner 200,000 souls before dying again, or his own soul will be sent to the shadow realm and locked forever."

Before consuming their soul, she forced herself on the leader of the paladins' team, which resulted 9 months later in a kyton-spawn tiefling. She loved her son so much and it broke one of her hearts when he fled to the mortal realms at age 13. She has been searching for him ever since, sending devil spies behind him in the world of men.

An army of smaller similar demons follow his ships along and wait patiently for the corpses of their master's fallen ennemies to be thrown from the side of the boat. If you see Hilderoy's flag approaching, abandoning your ship and jumping into the water is probably the worst thing you can do, for a quick death by sword is preferable to being eaten alive."

Unusually among the scholarly Phistophilus, Praelix loves to engage in discussions of strategy and tactics and will even don his custom leather armor (though best not to ask WHAT leather) and ride out on occasion. Some Diabolists consider Praelix's preference for claiming the souls of warriors to be a sign of intellectual weakness, a misapprehension Praelix himself readily encourages. Jovial and helpful, he affects the manners of a country gent - he even has a drawing room with weapons mounted on the wall. Each one is bloody and broken, and each is wrapped in a contract."

Using his natural ability to shapeshift he gains access to the most powerful people in the land and gains their trust. The reason for his longevity is unknown though it is most likely due to the large sum of knowledge acquired over his time spent collecting artifacts and among the educated. The one thing he cannot hide with his shapeshifting is the eye of vecna that he has replaced one of his eyes with. Most if not all of his shapeshifted forms wears an eyepatch or similar way of masking it and they all tend to hum. Very few if any people can actually guess at his existence in the world however every child is taught the Oni's Rhyme: Lock the door, blow out the light; The hungry oni haunts the night. Hide and tremble, little one; The oni wants to have some fun."

Not content with other demons' blind madness, the Creeping Hunger is driven and focused by his demonic desires. He plans and schemes like the best of devils, but ever the rage and hunger lingers beneath, cresting to the surface when things don't go his way. Of particular interest to him is answering the call of warlocks seeking a pact with devils. When he presents himself as such, he provides maddeningly complex contracts and asks for little in return for access to his power, masquerading as the lawful entities the warlock has planned for. However, he devotes himself to twisting the warlock's goals to base consumption and destruction, culminating in the eventual ruin of the warlock and the acquisition of many souls for Miasmus."

A freak of nature, her nest lays in the center of a garden of petrified victims.

Unwary treasure hunters looking to steal the wizard's old loot find their sanity wrenched away if they're lucky; if they're unlucky, they join Grazzab's retinue as Shadows that help guard the idol housing the demon's essence."

   "Name": "Chamdar, the Soul Binder",
   "Description": "Chamdar is a Chain Devil who delights in tempting mortals into dark pacts and contracts, and then using said mortals for sadistic experiments into the nature of suffering and torment once the terms of the deal are up. Chamdar first began to exert influence over the Prime when a sorcerer in a war-torn country sought to keep his family safe from the fighting--in exchange for helping construct an arcane sanctuary, Chamdar wrenched away the sorcerer's soul and tormented his family mercilessly in the sanctuary, often using the sorcerer himself to inflict the torments. Every night, the sorcerer had his sanity ripped away and he murdered his family in cold blood, only to later be confronted with what he had done. However, due to the nature of the contract, each day his family is restored to life, their memories fully intact, but the sorcerer's recollections were wiped away. Chamdar delights in watching just how torturous the family relations have become."

The ice devil subconciouly whispers to him and incites his hatred for and anger at others. Because of the devil's whispers, he considers sorcerer's magic more pure than wizard magic (\"it comes from the soul\" etc...) and was greatly angered by most wizarding schools for his inability to produce or use any sorcerer spells that did not involve ice or water, and has withdrawn to a keep made of ice to attempt to learn how to produce any non-ice related magic. He is very bitter and hateful of the wizarding community and is very hostile to any other sorcerers' use of non-ice magic. (When he left one of the schools, he stole a wish scroll from one of the teachers and used it to imbue himself with the natural ability to detect magic. As a sad sort of irony; due to his inexperience with any non-ice magic, the effect the wish spell granted him was the ability to detect ice-related magic only, which only makes it easier for him to become angry at the use of non-ice magic.) All of his sorcerer spells must be ice themed/related: Ex. Magic missile shoots ice bolts, he cannot cast fireball with sorcerer slots, Floating disc and Mage armor are made out of ice, burning hands deals frost/cold damage, etc. He much prefers using his sorcerer spells than his wizard spells as he considers them 'unpure', but he considers himself worthy to use them over others because he has innate magical ability as well."

Realizing he didn't have the power to do it on his own, he began making deals with other being, terrifyingly powerful beings, to help him gain the power to continue on his righteous quest. Eventually he grew more powerful than even the entities who granted him this power, and so he turned against them, breaking his word and slaying them all.

After the men slaughtered the herds, the giants took to eating the men's sheep and cattle when meat north of the Hoaries became scarce in the winter months. Yonal Yoglas decided long ago that to save the giants, they would have to face near starvation for decades as they gathered their strength from the scattered caves in the high passes.

Already cool relations between the 'noble' races and their Orcish cousins had been exacerbated by the outbreak of the Patron Wars, and overnight, donating to the 'Half-Orc Orphan's Fund' went from high-profile charity to social suicide. As money ran low and the front moved closer, the working clergy found themselves in an impossible situation. Many fled from (or in some cases, to) the fighting, leaving only a handful of nuns to care for, protect and feed nearly two hundred children. With tensions fraying and food running low, Sister Lunette made the 'hard decision'; in the early morning, just after prayers, she methodically slaughtered almost sixty half-orc children with a pair of pruning shears. The other nuns, hesitant to turn their friend over to the authorities, restrained her with yards of knotted bed linens, and locked poor Lunette in the farthest corner of the cellar. A fictional Orc barbarian was named as the perpetrator of the heinous (if understandable) crime, and soon after the remaining orphans were dispersed and the orphanage shuttered. In one last, merciful act, the departing nuns unlocked the cellar, leaving Sister Lunette to the mercy of their God."

Then he teleports himself and the corpse to a butcher shop in a goblin town, where the butcher pays him quite handsomely for each child produced, as the meat is quite popular with the town's residents. Kral himself looks upon it as doing both places a favor. As the city doesn't care about the children, as rarely does anyone follow up to find out what happened to a child they drop off. When they do, he tells them that the child was adopted by a wandering family of caravaneers and could be anywhere by now."

Instead of a neck, it has a large flabby sack (like a frog's) that droops all the way down to its feet. It dwells in the deepest, most abandoned forests where civilization is far away. Its origins and motivations are unknown, but it dwells on one thing: to cause terror. The large sack on its neck houses a lung of poison that it secretes into the nearby atmosphere. One whiff of the gas, and the inhaler starts hallucinating: gigantic monsters chase them, they fall down a hole to hell, or their friends betray them. The hallucinations seem longer than they actually are. No harm is done to the person during the hallucinations, but almost all victims commit suicide or go insane due to terror. In their brief moments of lucidity, when their minds resist the poison, victims report a horrific croaking, and see a frail man perched on a tree fanning a large sack before they fall into another living nightmare."

From a distance, the creature blends in with the branches of the tree. Then, while the victim is inside, its many mouths begin to simulate sounds of a far away celebration or party. Once the victim moves out to investigate, the Spindle stabs the creature and absorbs its skin into its skeletal frame, adding another mouth to its collection, and another voice to tempt travelers with."

   "Description": "After a powerful storm at sea, debris from the bottom of the ocean often float to the surface for sailors to claim or avoid. Most sailors can recognize a normal salvage: seaweed, wood scraps, maybe a fragment from an old ship. However, the most seasoned sailors will tell the deckhands to never claim anything from the waves in fear of the Dredge. if you ever see a locked chest, a woman screaming for help, or something that seems too good to be true, it's often the Dredge's tendrils tempting a young sailor to his death. Appearing after storms, the mess of tentacles and tendrils called the Dredge displays a tempting display of salvage that it collects: the items often are exactly what sailors want, sometimes even personal items. It's unknown where the creature gets these items, but as soon as anyone attempts to grab one, even if they use a hook or net, the tendril reels them into the deep with amazing force. None of them ever return."

   "Name": "The Blood Merchant",
   "Description": "Most cannot stomach the varied sacs and chambers that comprise the back of this creature, filled with the lifeblood of countless beings. While most often patronized by vampires and such bloodthirsty ilk, morally bankrupt mages also peruse the beast's services. It barters in some of its gains with those that would provide it benefit, but saves the choice liquids for itself. Its multiple needle-like proboscides twitch in anticipation of it's next meal."

   "Name": "The Flying Madness",
   "Description": "The Mind Flayers desire to consume the minds of the living, but there are minds so powerful even the Illithids are mad to attempt them. Whether it was a single Flayer or a group, it will never be known, but they attempted to eat the mind of an ancient Gold Dragon. The might of dragons is not that of mortals, especially those old enough to remember the making of the world. But the Illithids are in their own way beyond the world, and instead of consuming the dragon's mind or being consumed in turn, a horrid fusion resulted. The Dragon, its original name now forgotten, has misshapen tentacles sprouting from where its face once was, like fungal bodies. Where its eyes should be are suppurating pits, forever dripping corrupting slime. Its once lustrous hide is now pocked and rotted. It flies randomly across the land, shrieking a terrible silent scream that is heard in the minds of people miles away. Anyone who falls under the shadow of its wings is driven irrevocably mad."

 {
   "Name": "The Cogs",
   "Description": "Long ago, a Dwarven king called for the creation of a Wonder, a mighty walking fortress that could bring war to the most distant enemy. The mightiest and most skilled artisans worked for ten generations, until the castle was complete. Taking the form of an enormous Dwarf, it could stride across rivers and smash through castle walls with ease. However, they made it too well. The complex mechanisms inside it, designed to allow it to repair itself, began to leech minerals from the rocks themselves, and eventually subsumed the Dwarves who dwelt inside it to become part of its mechanism. It is named after the tiny automata it creates, that form the first sign of its coming. Tiny things made of cogs swarm ahead of it, scouring the land of everything - animal, vegetable, or mineral. Everything is ripped apart into its component parts and conveyed back to the main fortress, now a bloated monstrosity of metal and stone. Inside, organic matter entwines around cog and wheel, forming a hideous fusion of meat and metal. Left to itself, it will scour the world clean of everything until it sits alone on the earth."

 {
   "Name": "The Eating Slick",
   "Description": "Summer is often a time of relaxation and ease, at least for those few that can afford it. One of the greatest pastimes of summer, then, is swimming, often in a lake, reservoir, or similar water source. In one such lake, secluded and idyllic, lives the Eating Slick. It is difficult to see, even under the best conditions; it manifests as a silent black circle that forms seamlessly to the water of its lake, not unlike an oil slick. Appearance is where the similarities end. The Eating Slick moves under its own power, and is utterly predatorial. It allows unsuspecting swimmers to move out into deeper waters, and once there, it consumes them. Whole. Its surface is like that of an Ooze, dissolving and searing flesh on contact, and with each eaten victim it grows. We are lucky that it lives in a lake; should it ever reach the ocean, there's no telling what horrors could result."

 {
   "Name": "The Unhappy Blob",
   "Description": "It was caught in the dark recesses of a cave and transported to the fortress where it was put into a deep pit. It wasn't happy about that, but then these strange creatures that caught it started throwing other such creatures down into the pit for it to eat, and that made the blob happy. It was quite happy for quite sometime, as the creatures would gather on the edge of the pit, make strange noises and then throw a usually still struggling creature much like themselves down into the pit for the blob to happily spend time digesting. But, then one day the Blob noticed that the creatures had stopped coming, and had stopped throwing him food. This made the Blob unhappy, and so the Blob decided to ooze his way up the sides of his pit and go in search of food. Which is really too bad for that nearby town."

 {
   "Name": "The Lady of Justice",
   "Description": "In a small mountain town there is a bronze statue of a woman holding an olive branch in one hand and a sword in the other. Before this woman is a bronze scale. Sitting in the basin opposite this woman are four small bronze men, sitting in the basin before this woman is empty space. Whenever a man or woman commits a crime, they are brought before the Lady of Justice, and put their head on the scales to be judged. Through strange mechanisms their sins are weighed. If they are innocent, the men will fall and the Lady offers them an olive branch. If they are guilty, the Lady swings her mighty blade and slays them. The angrier the townsfolk, the more vigorous the Lady strikes. A bloodthirsty mob throws a fugitive at her feet, willing the scales to tip. The criminal's head meets the scales and the men raise in judgement. The Lady tears away her face to deliver the kind justice the people truly crave."

 {
   "Name": "The Ashen Legion",
   "Description": "The Ashen Legion is a force of conquest in it's purest form. It has no king and no nation. The grey forms of men in armor from a time long since passed leave a thick cloud of choking ash wherever they march. People in their path of all races and creeds are cut-down without thought. Their mute commanders mull over the tactics to take whatever happens to be in their path, issuing commands only the grey soldiers seem to hear. They ignore any other attempts at communication, dumb to reason and curses alike. The Ashen Legion burns cities to the ground, the only resource they value the ash of things that men have built. Felled soldiers return to the cloud, where they accumulate into new recruits, just as strong as the last generation. They hold territory simply for the sake of holding it, and they expand their borders with little rhyme or reason. Cities are razed, resources are ignored. Even though they march without purpose, their commanders are wily, and will win battles without pressing the Legion's immortality. Kingdoms are eradicated, ways of life are destroyed, women and children slain without thought as the Legion marches forward. And at the heart of their holdings an angry god lays slain, bleeding a pool tepid, grey War."

   "Name": "Resnin the Seer",
   "Description": "Best not to make deals with the devil, of course, you don't always know it's the devil you're dealing with. Resnin the Seer is not what you'd call monstrous by first glance but if you ever see behind the veil, your mind just might come loose. He resides in the lesser part of town, living above his small shop where he grants healing, potions, and untoward favors in return for a small favor from you. Somehow the things he gives you always leaves you coming back for more and the favors he asks grow darker. Your soul is going to be his eventually, just give him time. Then you can join the others that are trapped, pushing forward beneath his gnarled olive green skin, unable to escape this horrid fate."

   "Name": "Ol' Clayven",
   "Description": "Clayven was once an ordinary elf like you and I, or so the stories say. But Clayven, unlike most elves, was a greedy sort. He gathered everything he could and never let a treasure leave his grasp. As his horde grew, he had to grow bigger and bigger homes to store it all. He also had to create more and more guardians to keep others out, until he was eventually alone with only this constructs. Clayven grew more and more paranoid and mad going so far as to accuse his own constructed guardians of theft, eventually destroying all of them. Left to his own devices, he slowly grew malnourished, afraid to leave his treasures unguarded. With time, his body seemed to wither away and his home did as well. Those who have gotten close to his home, have been chased off by a nearly naked, pale, hunch backed creature with one large eye and long claws on each hand. As they ran, they swore they heard it scream, \"Mine!\""

   "Name": "The Tortured Man",
   "Description": "Certainly the tales invented by mothers to keep their children inside at night, the tale of the Tortured Man is told at bedtime when the lights are low. It is said that a man, down on his luck and hungry, entered illegally, the estate of a mad wizard to steal some food. Unfortunately the man was caught and drug down into the basement laboratory. Not seen for weeks on in, the man was presumed dead and lost. Now, each night, a horrific creature roams within the walls of the mad wizard's home. Its eyes gouged out and its mouth sewn shut. Where it had hands now only two metal claws and its legs removed below the knee. Outside the wall you can hear the clank, shuffle, and scraping as it patrols."

   "Name": "The Green Caves",
   "Description": "Within the foothills of Mount Glamoral lies a cave entrance mostly obscured by shrubbery. From the entrance a sickly green light can be seen welling up from further inside. If someone goes deeper into the cave, as the tunnels bury deeper into the earth, past a glowing green barrier of sigils lies a race of misshapen abominations. The spawn of a pit fiend and whatever wildlife once lived here, and it is said that at the deepest depths lies their ruler, that same fiend, who nurses a bitter hatred for the light above and those born in it."

   "Name": "The Breegard Gamekeeper",
   "Description": "Hunters and poachers know to stay out of the forest between Breegard and the mountain, but careless travellers are not so lucky. Those who make it into town will be told the story of the Gamekeeper. He was once employed by the local Lord to ensure a good stock of animals were available for the hunt and did his job so diligently that a deity recognised his labours and granted him an unnaturally long life. That was centuries ago, but far from feeling blessed the Gatekeeper is now insane, wretched and wracked by the years. He defends the forest from all intruders and has spent the centuries breeding his hounds into monstrous beasts which now only passingly resemble dogs. Now he seeks to extend his dominion to all the forests of the world, capturing and twisting any travelers he can find to serve his aims."

   "Name": "Alumar",
   "Description": "Alumar, the beast of poisoned light, was an elemental who once shone with the gentleness of sunshine. But in seeking to enhance her powers, she became a monster of sickness and death. Her light burns living creatures, and even fleeting exposure leads to fatal illnesses. Folk who encounter her lose hair and teeth and their skin erupts with blisters. Alumar believes that she can leach away her powers by inflicting them on any creatures she encounters, and hopes that if she spreads her light among enough creatures, she can one day return to the creature of mild light she once was."

 {
   "Name": "Kain",
   "Description": "Kain is as old as mankind itself, created by a handful of Gods as their would-be Assassin. Forged as a Demi God, the soul of a Dragon, and the body of a Devil. Kain is a Godslayer, accomplishing this by seeking out worshipers of his target God and slaying them in masses to weaken the God's power as Faith is the resource for a God's strength and sets their hierarchy within the heavens. Kain is genderless and uncaring for mortal wants and needs and seeks only to rid the heavens of his former masters. Kain wields a colossal Scythe that opens portals to other planes/dimensions and makes wounds near impossible to heal from. There's a laundry list of powers, abilities, and feats Kain has, but if you want to use this character you're free to do what you want (but you may PM to ask as well).

   "Name": "Mercer Leon, CEO Leon Trading",
   "Description": "The brand of Leon Trading is known to most adventurers as one of just enough quality to get by. Its rise to fortune and the mainstream was extremely fast, and somewhat suspicious. It is a common joke amongst the denizens of the Capital that Leon has some sort of oracular foreknowledge that prevents him from making a bad trade. They were more right than they would ever know."

   "Description": "Once upon a time, there were two lovers, joined in heaven and earth. A star spirit and a moonfolk, their commitment to each other was known throughout the plane. Kathera knew of her imminent mortality, but wished to stay by Aquila's side for eternity. Using ancient magic, she sealed her soul into her masterwork, a silver sword of finest craft. They were together, but the star spirit found his feelings did not possess the longevity that Kathera's did, and he cast the sword aside. The spirit of the moonfolk overpowers those who wield her blade, forcing them to seek out and destroy her traitorous lover."

   "Name": "Malandrach of Many Devices",
   "Description": "A dark elf who's quest to shift the world's political landscape from theocracy towards democracy forced him to take drastic measures, Malandrach achieved lichdom hundreds of years ago and has been gathering power ever since. Each attempt to realize his goal has failed, simply requiring more power. His research team, headed by the ingenious Doctor Cyrilla, develops creative new uses of the world's available technology, a notable one being a revolving barrel that allows quick access to different wands. Though his actions have in the past been towards the evil end of the spectrum, he is not evil for its own sake, instead hoping that this phase is a means to an end."

   "Name": "Archangel Avalon",
   "Description": "The Forces (capital F) are not really gods in the same way that mayonnaise isn't an instrument. They are divine in a completely different direction than the world's pantheon, almost quantifying their strength with imaginary numbers. Most of them do not interact with the material plane, and to fight one is as much a folly as to declare war on a forest, or the sky. Avalon, one of the weakest of their number, is the only one that will even reveal itself. Its body isn't entirely contained within the three dimensions we are used to, resembling the biblical descriptions of angels. It appears to those who cross heaven and earth seeking to challenge it, almost like an immature child wanted to demonstrate its power."

 {
   "Name": "The Black Helm of Sunbury Vale",
   "Description": "Usually, things such as the Black Helm take shape in a wizard's laboratory on a dark and stormy night. The Black Helm, however, was created by an unremarkable blacksmith in the small hamlet of Sunbury Vale. The blacksmith had crafted a fine suit of armour for a noble to wear in an upcoming tournament, and an apprentice of the local arm of the Mage's College had been tasked with enchanting it. Unfortunately for all involved, his spell went awry - the armour, instead of receiving a defensive charm, received a life of its own. The now-animated plate mail attacked the blacksmith for berating the apprentice mage, and killed him. The mage was put to death by the inhabitants of the village - this enraged the armour [a Helmed Horror], causing it to wipe out the village. It's twisted and damaged consciousness began to reflect the fault for the mage's death not only on the villagers, but on all it encountered. The Black Helm now wanders the countryside, gradually roaming farther and farther from Sunbury Vale in order to sate its thirst for vengeance against those who it thinks killed its creator and master."

 {
   "Name": "The Reacher",
   "Description": "No one really knows what the Reacher is, or where and when it came from. Some say that its kind originate in the interstitial spaces between multiverses. To say that they exist there would be a mistake - no one knows if existence as we perceive it is possible there, even as a concept. What little is known about the Reacher is based on myth, speculation, and anecdote. Physically, it appears as a bright blue skein of energy stretched across a human skeleton - perhaps the Reacher is a parasitic organism still possessing the body of a long-dead host, or perhaps it's merely the Reacher's way of normalising itself to the Material Plane and existence as beings of this particular multiverse perceive it. The most interesting facet of the Reacher's existence is its interactions with matter. It has been hypothesised that the Reacher exists in five dimensions in this universe - the three spatial dimensions we can perceive, the temporal dimensions, and a fourth spatial dimension that is incapable of being interacted with by any being in this universe. This means the Reacher is able to pass through any form of matter directed against it, and even alter time as it pertains to individual objects. Indeed, the Reacher's name comes from a memorable incident in the 893rd year of the 4th Era, when it reached through the walls of a box that had been magically sealed by the six Archmages of the Adamantine Court, and in the process aging it into dust. Should the Reacher ever turn its azure gaze upon you, know that there is no escape - it is everywhere and nowhere, everywhen and never."

   "Name": "The Lupenwald Fiend",
   "Description": "Deep in the heart of the massive Lupenwald forest, the trees all bend their branches towards a central towering pillar of volcanic glass. With the correct rituals, a little magic and an unwilling sacrifice, ancient oaken branches reach down and embrace the pillar's unfortunate victim. Then the Fiend rises. Eight and a half feet tall, it holds itself upright with four enormous, jointed branches sprouting from its lower back. The victim's body sways in the wind, little more than a warm moist shell for the Fiend. Soon people in nearby villages disappear, only to be found impaled on withered pine trees. The Fiend will not abandon its grim harvest till all the Lupenwald's trees may feed on blood and bone."

   "Name": "Barg Greenblood AKA Pukefist",
   "Description": "Once the chieftain of several hundred goblins living under Rockbilt Mountain, Barg was content to run his little kingdom and get fat on the offerings of his kin. All that changed on the day a group of adventurers came into his cave, killing most of Barg's family and friends. The \"heroes\" attacked Barg in cold blood and left him for dead alongside a green ooze that had infiltrated the caves. The lingering magic from the spells unleashed in the cave reacted with Barg's hand and the dead ooze it was resting in. The reaction had a strange effect: When he awoke after the fight, Barg's arm was no longer flesh and bone, but rather had become a limb made of ooze. Fueled by fury and anger, Pukefist (as his legend is known among local goblins), ambushes humans and elves alone on the roads near Rockbilt. He uses his ooze-arm to choke his victims, and in some cases will even use it to melt the skin off their faces. All that was once Barg, happy, content and full of food has disappeared and a thin, angry, mutated mess is all that remains."

   "Name": "Sek'ril",
   "Description": "War is oftentimes a horrific, monstrous thing, and that's exactly what war creates. The embodiment of death and decay, Sek'ril overtakes the lifeless corpses of war-torn victims. Most often seen in piles of bodies, Sek'ril slowly feeds off of them, growing in strength. He speaks not in words, but with psychic abilities and cares for only himself. Sek'ril desires nothing more than a meal, and if that means controlling weak minded men and women then so be it. At his peak levels of strength, Sek'ril has been know to cobble together animated corpse golems to his bidding, as well imbuing conscious thought into corpses, creating horrendous zombified servants."

   "Name": "Fargith, The Giver of Dreams",
   "Description": "It is said that there lives a roiling mound of flesh in the sewers beneath the city which possesses a malevolent mind. It kills two kinds of people. The first are blue eyed children. Some people who has seen the monstrosity says that it is incorporating the eyes into its own form. Forming them into a facsimile of a face; multi-faceted blue eyes, blue-eye-teeth, blue-eye-freckles. However, that is not all the eyes. Some are also found hanging on strings at random spots around the sewer. The second kind of people it kills are those that touch those eyes. Those people and their entire family. So, if you see a small, child-sized blue eye, hanging on a string, seeming like it is watching you, don't touch it. Just leave it alone. Said to be perhaps the most lethal assassin in the world. A figure wrapped in a hooded cloak of darkest black, beneath which appears to be only shadow. This is held up by those who proclaim him to have such abilities as being able to pass through barred windows and underneath locked doors. When the Shadow Assassin is hired, his victim is invariably found suffocated to death a few days later. But it is the payment that the Shadow Assassin demands that sets him apart: the person you love the most, passed by your hand to his. Nobody knows what happen to these loved ones when they are whisked away by the assassin. In the middle of the desert of Yum lies the City of Dreams. Some would say that it is ruled by a demon, but the demon himself and the people who seek him would say that it is served by a demon. For those that dwell in the City of Dreams have their every desire fulfilled by the demon. The resurrection of loved ones, a life in opulent luxury, the ability to kill and torture without risk or retribution. Newcomers to the city find it a kaleidoscope of dreams from the noble to the decadent to the horrifying. But all citizen are under the protection of the demon. By the power of the demon no citizen is allowed to experience any want or hurt or discomfort. Once a newcomer has accepted the demons pact and become a citizen, they never leave. Why would they?"

   "Name": "Unodoche",
   "Description": "Cursed by some ancient magic to live in transition between the material and inner elemental planes, Unodoche has no clear form; to see him is to see a distortion. Materially, he is a giant tentacled mass of flesh and muscle with no distinct head, rather various eyes, nostrils and mouths are cut randomly into the rubbery flesh of his body. As he moves he passes between planes so that only cross sections of his corporeal form are visible, and so to any who behold him he appears to flicker in and out of existence like flames do, only where orange and red transparencies would be, solid fragments of muscle and bone and sanguine fluid phase in and out of sight, morphing and deforming, as though being sliced apart and healing over and over again. Tortured by his horrific existence, he has grown hateful and violent. In the vast desert dunes of the Dead Empty where he is known to roam, the native wanderers say to keep your wits about you, for Unodoche is cruel and devours all who meet him."

He has a close-knit gang of troglodyte flunkies who collect for him seekers of highly appraised artifacts claiming to have them for sale. They are then liberated of their gold and fed into Gauul's giant gullet where he consumes them gleefully."
